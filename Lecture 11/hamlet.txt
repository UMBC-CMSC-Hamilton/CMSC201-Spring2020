For this relief much thanks tis bitter cold

Exit

MARCELLUS
Holla Bernardo
BERNARDO
Say
What is Horatio there
HORATIO
A piece of him
BERNARDO
Welcome Horatio welcome good Marcellus
MARCELLUS
What has this thing appeard again tonight
BERNARDO
I have seen nothing
MARCELLUS
Horatio says tis but our fantasy
And will not let belief take hold of him
Touching this dreaded sight twice seen of us
Therefore I have entreated him along
With us to watch the minutes of this night
That if again this apparition come
He may approve our eyes and speak to it
HORATIO
Tush tush twill not appear
BERNARDO
Sit down awhile
And let us once again assail your ears
That are so fortified against our story
What we have two nights seen
HORATIO
Well sit we down
And let us hear Bernardo speak of this
BERNARDO
Last night of all
When yond same star thats westward from the pole
Had made his course to illume that part of heaven
Where now it burns Marcellus and myself
The bell then beating one
Enter Ghost

MARCELLUS
Peace break thee off look where it comes again
BERNARDO
In the same figure like the king thats dead
MARCELLUS
Thou art a scholar speak to it Horatio
BERNARDO
Looks it not like the king mark it Horatio
HORATIO
Most like it harrows me with fear and wonder
BERNARDO
It would be spoke to
MARCELLUS
Question it Horatio
HORATIO
What art thou that usurpst this time of night
Together with that fair and warlike form
In which the majesty of buried Denmark
Did sometimes march by heaven I charge thee speak
MARCELLUS
It is offended
BERNARDO
See it stalks away
HORATIO
Stay speak speak I charge thee speak
Exit Ghost

MARCELLUS
Tis gone and will not answer
BERNARDO
How now Horatio you tremble and look pale
Is not this something more than fantasy
What think you ont
HORATIO
Before my God I might not this believe
Without the sensible and true avouch
Of mine own eyes
MARCELLUS
Is it not like the king
HORATIO
As thou art to thyself
Such was the very armour he had on
When he the ambitious Norway combated
So frownd he once when in an angry parle
He smote the sledded Polacks on the ice
Tis strange
MARCELLUS
Thus twice before and jump at this dead hour
With martial stalk hath he gone by our watch
HORATIO
In what particular thought to work I know not
But in the gross and scope of my opinion
This bodes some strange eruption to our state
MARCELLUS
Good now sit down and tell me he that knows
Why this same strict and most observant watch
So nightly toils the subject of the land
And why such daily cast of brazen cannon
And foreign mart for implements of war
Why such impress of shipwrights whose sore task
Does not divide the Sunday from the week
What might be toward that this sweaty haste
Doth make the night jointlabourer with the day
Who ist that can inform me
HORATIO
That can I
At least the whisper goes so Our last king
Whose image even but now appeard to us
Was as you know by Fortinbras of Norway
Thereto prickd on by a most emulate pride
Dared to the combat in which our valiant Hamlet
For so this side of our known world esteemd him
Did slay this Fortinbras who by a seald compact
Well ratified by law and heraldry
Did forfeit with his life all those his lands
Which he stood seized of to the conqueror
Against the which a moiety competent
Was gaged by our king which had returnd
To the inheritance of Fortinbras
Had he been vanquisher as by the same covenant
And carriage of the article designd
His fell to Hamlet Now sir young Fortinbras
Of unimproved mettle hot and full
Hath in the skirts of Norway here and there
Sharkd up a list of lawless resolutes
For food and diet to some enterprise
That hath a stomach int which is no other
As it doth well appear unto our state
But to recover of us by strong hand
And terms compulsatory those foresaid lands
So by his father lost and this I take it
Is the main motive of our preparations
The source of this our watch and the chief head
Of this posthaste and romage in the land
BERNARDO
I think it be no other but een so
Well may it sort that this portentous figure
Comes armed through our watch so like the king
That was and is the question of these wars
HORATIO
A mote it is to trouble the minds eye
In the most high and palmy state of Rome
A little ere the mightiest Julius fell
The graves stood tenantless and the sheeted dead
Did squeak and gibber in the Roman streets
As stars with trains of fire and dews of blood
Disasters in the sun and the moist star
Upon whose influence Neptunes empire stands
Was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse
And even the like precurse of fierce events
As harbingers preceding still the fates
And prologue to the omen coming on
Have heaven and earth together demonstrated
Unto our climatures and countrymen
But soft behold lo where it comes again
Reenter Ghost

Ill cross it though it blast me Stay illusion
If thou hast any sound or use of voice
Speak to me
If there be any good thing to be done
That may to thee do ease and grace to me
Speak to me
Cock crows

If thou art privy to thy countrys fate
Which happily foreknowing may avoid O speak
Or if thou hast uphoarded in thy life
Extorted treasure in the womb of earth
For which they say you spirits oft walk in death
Speak of it stay and speak Stop it Marcellus
MARCELLUS
Shall I strike at it with my partisan
HORATIO
Do if it will not stand
BERNARDO
Tis here
HORATIO
Tis here
MARCELLUS
Tis gone
Exit Ghost

We do it wrong being so majestical
To offer it the show of violence
For it is as the air invulnerable
And our vain blows malicious mockery
BERNARDO
It was about to speak when the cock crew
HORATIO
And then it started like a guilty thing
Upon a fearful summons I have heard
The cock that is the trumpet to the morn
Doth with his lofty and shrillsounding throat
Awake the god of day and at his warning
Whether in sea or fire in earth or air
The extravagant and erring spirit hies
To his confine and of the truth herein
This present object made probation
MARCELLUS
It faded on the crowing of the cock
Some say that ever gainst that season comes
Wherein our Saviours birth is celebrated
The bird of dawning singeth all night long
And then they say no spirit dares stir abroad
The nights are wholesome then no planets strike
No fairy takes nor witch hath power to charm
So hallowd and so gracious is the time
HORATIO
So have I heard and do in part believe it
But look the morn in russet mantle clad
Walks oer the dew of yon high eastward hill
Break we our watch up and by my advice
Let us impart what we have seen tonight
Unto young Hamlet for upon my life
This spirit dumb to us will speak to him
Do you consent we shall acquaint him with it
As needful in our loves fitting our duty
MARCELLUS
Lets dot I pray and I this morning know
Where we shall find him most conveniently
Exeunt

SCENE II A room of state in the castle
Enter KING CLAUDIUS QUEEN GERTRUDE HAMLET POLONIUS LAERTES VOLTIMAND CORNELIUS Lords and Attendants
KING CLAUDIUS
Though yet of Hamlet our dear brothers death
The memory be green and that it us befitted
To bear our hearts in grief and our whole kingdom
To be contracted in one brow of woe
Yet so far hath discretion fought with nature
That we with wisest sorrow think on him
Together with remembrance of ourselves
Therefore our sometime sister now our queen
The imperial jointress to this warlike state
Have we as twere with a defeated joy
With an auspicious and a dropping eye
With mirth in funeral and with dirge in marriage
In equal scale weighing delight and dole
Taken to wife nor have we herein barrd
Your better wisdoms which have freely gone
With this affair along For all our thanks
Now follows that you know young Fortinbras
Holding a weak supposal of our worth
Or thinking by our late dear brothers death
Our state to be disjoint and out of frame
Colleagued with the dream of his advantage
He hath not faild to pester us with message
Importing the surrender of those lands
Lost by his father with all bonds of law
To our most valiant brother So much for him
Now for ourself and for this time of meeting
Thus much the business is we have here writ
To Norway uncle of young Fortinbras
Who impotent and bedrid scarcely hears
Of this his nephews purposeto suppress
His further gait herein in that the levies
The lists and full proportions are all made
Out of his subject and we here dispatch
You good Cornelius and you Voltimand
For bearers of this greeting to old Norway
Giving to you no further personal power
To business with the king more than the scope
Of these delated articles allow
Farewell and let your haste commend your duty
CORNELIUS VOLTIMAND
In that and all things will we show our duty
KING CLAUDIUS
We doubt it nothing heartily farewell
Exeunt VOLTIMAND and CORNELIUS

And now Laertes whats the news with you
You told us of some suit what ist Laertes
You cannot speak of reason to the Dane
And loose your voice what wouldst thou beg Laertes
That shall not be my offer not thy asking
The head is not more native to the heart
The hand more instrumental to the mouth
Than is the throne of Denmark to thy father
What wouldst thou have Laertes
LAERTES
My dread lord
Your leave and favour to return to France
From whence though willingly I came to Denmark
To show my duty in your coronation
Yet now I must confess that duty done
My thoughts and wishes bend again toward France
And bow them to your gracious leave and pardon
KING CLAUDIUS
Have you your fathers leave What says Polonius
LORD POLONIUS
He hath my lord wrung from me my slow leave
By laboursome petition and at last
Upon his will I seald my hard consent
I do beseech you give him leave to go
KING CLAUDIUS
Take thy fair hour Laertes time be thine
And thy best graces spend it at thy will
But now my cousin Hamlet and my son
HAMLET
Aside A little more than kin and less than kind
KING CLAUDIUS
How is it that the clouds still hang on you
HAMLET
Not so my lord I am too much i the sun
QUEEN GERTRUDE
Good Hamlet cast thy nighted colour off
And let thine eye look like a friend on Denmark
Do not for ever with thy vailed lids
Seek for thy noble father in the dust
Thou knowst tis common all that lives must die
Passing through nature to eternity
HAMLET
Ay madam it is common
QUEEN GERTRUDE
If it be
Why seems it so particular with thee
HAMLET
Seems madam nay it is I know not seems
Tis not alone my inky cloak good mother
Nor customary suits of solemn black
Nor windy suspiration of forced breath
No nor the fruitful river in the eye
Nor the dejected havior of the visage
Together with all forms moods shapes of grief
That can denote me truly these indeed seem
For they are actions that a man might play
But I have that within which passeth show
These but the trappings and the suits of woe
KING CLAUDIUS
Tis sweet and commendable in your nature Hamlet
To give these mourning duties to your father
But you must know your father lost a father
That father lost lost his and the survivor bound
In filial obligation for some term
To do obsequious sorrow but to persever
In obstinate condolement is a course
Of impious stubbornness tis unmanly grief
It shows a will most incorrect to heaven
A heart unfortified a mind impatient
An understanding simple and unschoold
For what we know must be and is as common
As any the most vulgar thing to sense
Why should we in our peevish opposition
Take it to heart Fie tis a fault to heaven
A fault against the dead a fault to nature
To reason most absurd whose common theme
Is death of fathers and who still hath cried
From the first corse till he that died today
This must be so We pray you throw to earth
This unprevailing woe and think of us
As of a father for let the world take note
You are the most immediate to our throne
And with no less nobility of love
Than that which dearest father bears his son
Do I impart toward you For your intent
In going back to school in Wittenberg
It is most retrograde to our desire
And we beseech you bend you to remain
Here in the cheer and comfort of our eye
Our chiefest courtier cousin and our son
QUEEN GERTRUDE
Let not thy mother lose her prayers Hamlet
I pray thee stay with us go not to Wittenberg
HAMLET
I shall in all my best obey you madam
KING CLAUDIUS
Why tis a loving and a fair reply
Be as ourself in Denmark Madam come
This gentle and unforced accord of Hamlet
Sits smiling to my heart in grace whereof
No jocund health that Denmark drinks today
But the great cannon to the clouds shall tell
And the kings rouse the heavens all bruit again
Respeaking earthly thunder Come away
Exeunt all but HAMLET

HAMLET
O that this too too solid flesh would melt
Thaw and resolve itself into a dew
Or that the Everlasting had not fixd
His canon gainst selfslaughter O God God
How weary stale flat and unprofitable
Seem to me all the uses of this world
Fie ont ah fie tis an unweeded garden
That grows to seed things rank and gross in nature
Possess it merely That it should come to this
But two months dead nay not so much not two
So excellent a king that was to this
Hyperion to a satyr so loving to my mother
That he might not beteem the winds of heaven
Visit her face too roughly Heaven and earth
Must I remember why she would hang on him
As if increase of appetite had grown
By what it fed on and yet within a month
Let me not think ontFrailty thy name is woman
A little month or ere those shoes were old
With which she followd my poor fathers body
Like Niobe all tearswhy she even she
O God a beast that wants discourse of reason
Would have mournd longermarried with my uncle
My fathers brother but no more like my father
Than I to Hercules within a month
Ere yet the salt of most unrighteous tears
Had left the flushing in her galled eyes
She married O most wicked speed to post
With such dexterity to incestuous sheets
It is not nor it cannot come to good
But break my heart for I must hold my tongue
Enter HORATIO MARCELLUS and BERNARDO

HORATIO
Hail to your lordship
HAMLET
I am glad to see you well
Horatioor I do forget myself
HORATIO
The same my lord and your poor servant ever
HAMLET
Sir my good friend Ill change that name with you
And what make you from Wittenberg Horatio Marcellus
MARCELLUS
My good lord
HAMLET
I am very glad to see you Good even sir
But what in faith make you from Wittenberg
HORATIO
A truant disposition good my lord
HAMLET
I would not hear your enemy say so
Nor shall you do mine ear that violence
To make it truster of your own report
Against yourself I know you are no truant
But what is your affair in Elsinore
Well teach you to drink deep ere you depart
HORATIO
My lord I came to see your fathers funeral
HAMLET
I pray thee do not mock me fellowstudent
I think it was to see my mothers wedding
HORATIO
Indeed my lord it followd hard upon
HAMLET
Thrift thrift Horatio the funeral baked meats
Did coldly furnish forth the marriage tables
Would I had met my dearest foe in heaven
Or ever I had seen that day Horatio
My fathermethinks I see my father
HORATIO
Where my lord
HAMLET
In my minds eye Horatio
HORATIO
I saw him once he was a goodly king
HAMLET
He was a man take him for all in all
I shall not look upon his like again
HORATIO
My lord I think I saw him yesternight
HAMLET
Saw who
HORATIO
My lord the king your father
HAMLET
The king my father
HORATIO
Season your admiration for awhile
With an attent ear till I may deliver
Upon the witness of these gentlemen
This marvel to you
HAMLET
For Gods love let me hear
HORATIO
Two nights together had these gentlemen
Marcellus and Bernardo on their watch
In the dead vast and middle of the night
Been thus encounterd A figure like your father
Armed at point exactly capape
Appears before them and with solemn march
Goes slow and stately by them thrice he walkd
By their oppressd and fearsurprised eyes
Within his truncheons length whilst they distilled
Almost to jelly with the act of fear
Stand dumb and speak not to him This to me
In dreadful secrecy impart they did
And I with them the third night kept the watch
Where as they had deliverd both in time
Form of the thing each word made true and good
The apparition comes I knew your father
These hands are not more like
HAMLET
But where was this
MARCELLUS
My lord upon the platform where we watchd
HAMLET
Did you not speak to it
HORATIO
My lord I did
But answer made it none yet once methought
It lifted up its head and did address
Itself to motion like as it would speak
But even then the morning cock crew loud
And at the sound it shrunk in haste away
And vanishd from our sight
HAMLET
Tis very strange
HORATIO
As I do live my honourd lord tis true
And we did think it writ down in our duty
To let you know of it
HAMLET
Indeed indeed sirs but this troubles me
Hold you the watch tonight
MARCELLUS BERNARDO
We do my lord
HAMLET
Armd say you
MARCELLUS BERNARDO
Armd my lord
HAMLET
From top to toe
MARCELLUS BERNARDO
My lord from head to foot
HAMLET
Then saw you not his face
HORATIO
O yes my lord he wore his beaver up
HAMLET
What lookd he frowningly
HORATIO
A countenance more in sorrow than in anger
HAMLET
Pale or red
HORATIO
Nay very pale
HAMLET
And fixd his eyes upon you
HORATIO
Most constantly
HAMLET
I would I had been there
HORATIO
It would have much amazed you
HAMLET
Very like very like Stayd it long
HORATIO
While one with moderate haste might tell a hundred
MARCELLUS BERNARDO
Longer longer
HORATIO
Not when I sawt
HAMLET
His beard was grizzledno
HORATIO
It was as I have seen it in his life
A sable silverd
HAMLET
I will watch tonight
Perchance twill walk again
HORATIO
I warrant it will
HAMLET
If it assume my noble fathers person
Ill speak to it though hell itself should gape
And bid me hold my peace I pray you all
If you have hitherto conceald this sight
Let it be tenable in your silence still
And whatsoever else shall hap tonight
Give it an understanding but no tongue
I will requite your loves So fare you well
Upon the platform twixt eleven and twelve
Ill visit you
All
Our duty to your honour
HAMLET
Your loves as mine to you farewell
Exeunt all but HAMLET

My fathers spirit in arms all is not well
I doubt some foul play would the night were come
Till then sit still my soul foul deeds will rise
Though all the earth oerwhelm them to mens eyes
Exit

SCENE III A room in Polonius house
Enter LAERTES and OPHELIA
LAERTES
My necessaries are embarkd farewell
And sister as the winds give benefit
And convoy is assistant do not sleep
But let me hear from you
OPHELIA
Do you doubt that
LAERTES
For Hamlet and the trifling of his favour
Hold it a fashion and a toy in blood
A violet in the youth of primy nature
Forward not permanent sweet not lasting
The perfume and suppliance of a minute No more
OPHELIA
No more but so
LAERTES
Think it no more
For nature crescent does not grow alone
In thews and bulk but as this temple waxes
The inward service of the mind and soul
Grows wide withal Perhaps he loves you now
And now no soil nor cautel doth besmirch
The virtue of his will but you must fear
His greatness weighd his will is not his own
For he himself is subject to his birth
He may not as unvalued persons do
Carve for himself for on his choice depends
The safety and health of this whole state
And therefore must his choice be circumscribed
Unto the voice and yielding of that body
Whereof he is the head Then if he says he loves you
It fits your wisdom so far to believe it
As he in his particular act and place
May give his saying deed which is no further
Than the main voice of Denmark goes withal
Then weigh what loss your honour may sustain
If with too credent ear you list his songs
Or lose your heart or your chaste treasure open
To his unmasterd importunity
Fear it Ophelia fear it my dear sister
And keep you in the rear of your affection
Out of the shot and danger of desire
The chariest maid is prodigal enough
If she unmask her beauty to the moon
Virtue itself scapes not calumnious strokes
The canker galls the infants of the spring
Too oft before their buttons be disclosed
And in the morn and liquid dew of youth
Contagious blastments are most imminent
Be wary then best safety lies in fear
Youth to itself rebels though none else near
OPHELIA
I shall the effect of this good lesson keep
As watchman to my heart But good my brother
Do not as some ungracious pastors do
Show me the steep and thorny way to heaven
Whiles like a puffd and reckless libertine
Himself the primrose path of dalliance treads
And recks not his own rede
LAERTES
O fear me not
I stay too long but here my father comes
Enter POLONIUS

A double blessing is a double grace
Occasion smiles upon a second leave
LORD POLONIUS
Yet here Laertes aboard aboard for shame
The wind sits in the shoulder of your sail
And you are stayd for There my blessing with thee
And these few precepts in thy memory
See thou character Give thy thoughts no tongue
Nor any unproportioned thought his act
Be thou familiar but by no means vulgar
Those friends thou hast and their adoption tried
Grapple them to thy soul with hoops of steel
But do not dull thy palm with entertainment
Of each newhatchd unfledged comrade Beware
Of entrance to a quarrel but being in
Beart that the opposed may beware of thee
Give every man thy ear but few thy voice
Take each mans censure but reserve thy judgment
Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy
But not expressd in fancy rich not gaudy
For the apparel oft proclaims the man
And they in France of the best rank and station
Are of a most select and generous chief in that
Neither a borrower nor a lender be
For loan oft loses both itself and friend
And borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry
This above all to thine ownself be true
And it must follow as the night the day
Thou canst not then be false to any man
Farewell my blessing season this in thee
LAERTES
Most humbly do I take my leave my lord
LORD POLONIUS
The time invites you go your servants tend
LAERTES
Farewell Ophelia and remember well
What I have said to you
OPHELIA
Tis in my memory lockd
And you yourself shall keep the key of it
LAERTES
Farewell
Exit

LORD POLONIUS
What ist Ophelia be hath said to you
OPHELIA
So please you something touching the Lord Hamlet
LORD POLONIUS
Marry well bethought
Tis told me he hath very oft of late
Given private time to you and you yourself
Have of your audience been most free and bounteous
If it be so as so tis put on me
And that in way of caution I must tell you
You do not understand yourself so clearly
As it behoves my daughter and your honour
What is between you give me up the truth
OPHELIA
He hath my lord of late made many tenders
Of his affection to me
LORD POLONIUS
Affection pooh you speak like a green girl
Unsifted in such perilous circumstance
Do you believe his tenders as you call them
OPHELIA
I do not know my lord what I should think
LORD POLONIUS
Marry Ill teach you think yourself a baby
That you have taen these tenders for true pay
Which are not sterling Tender yourself more dearly
Ornot to crack the wind of the poor phrase
Running it thusyoull tender me a fool
OPHELIA
My lord he hath importuned me with love
In honourable fashion
LORD POLONIUS
Ay fashion you may call it go to go to
OPHELIA
And hath given countenance to his speech my lord
With almost all the holy vows of heaven
LORD POLONIUS
Ay springes to catch woodcocks I do know
When the blood burns how prodigal the soul
Lends the tongue vows these blazes daughter
Giving more light than heat extinct in both
Even in their promise as it is amaking
You must not take for fire From this time
Be somewhat scanter of your maiden presence
Set your entreatments at a higher rate
Than a command to parley For Lord Hamlet
Believe so much in him that he is young
And with a larger tether may he walk
Than may be given you in few Ophelia
Do not believe his vows for they are brokers
Not of that dye which their investments show
But mere implorators of unholy suits
Breathing like sanctified and pious bawds
The better to beguile This is for all
I would not in plain terms from this time forth
Have you so slander any moment leisure
As to give words or talk with the Lord Hamlet
Look tot I charge you come your ways
OPHELIA
I shall obey my lord
Exeunt

SCENE IV The platform
Enter HAMLET HORATIO and MARCELLUS
HAMLET
The air bites shrewdly it is very cold
HORATIO
It is a nipping and an eager air
HAMLET
What hour now
HORATIO
I think it lacks of twelve
HAMLET
No it is struck
HORATIO
Indeed I heard it not then it draws near the season
Wherein the spirit held his wont to walk
A flourish of trumpets and ordnance shot off within

What does this mean my lord
HAMLET
The king doth wake tonight and takes his rouse
Keeps wassail and the swaggering upspring reels
And as he drains his draughts of Rhenish down
The kettledrum and trumpet thus bray out
The triumph of his pledge
HORATIO
Is it a custom
HAMLET
Ay marry ist
But to my mind though I am native here
And to the manner born it is a custom
More honourd in the breach than the observance
This heavyheaded revel east and west
Makes us traduced and taxd of other nations
They clepe us drunkards and with swinish phrase
Soil our addition and indeed it takes
From our achievements though performd at height
The pith and marrow of our attribute
So oft it chances in particular men
That for some vicious mole of nature in them
As in their birthwherein they are not guilty
Since nature cannot choose his origin
By the oergrowth of some complexion
Oft breaking down the pales and forts of reason
Or by some habit that too much oerleavens
The form of plausive manners that these men
Carrying I say the stamp of one defect
Being natures livery or fortunes star
Their virtues elsebe they as pure as grace
As infinite as man may undergo
Shall in the general censure take corruption
From that particular fault the dram of eale
Doth all the noble substance of a doubt
To his own scandal
HORATIO
Look my lord it comes
Enter Ghost

HAMLET
Angels and ministers of grace defend us
Be thou a spirit of health or goblin damnd
Bring with thee airs from heaven or blasts from hell
Be thy intents wicked or charitable
Thou comest in such a questionable shape
That I will speak to thee Ill call thee Hamlet
King father royal Dane O answer me
Let me not burst in ignorance but tell
Why thy canonized bones hearsed in death
Have burst their cerements why the sepulchre
Wherein we saw thee quietly inurnd
Hath oped his ponderous and marble jaws
To cast thee up again What may this mean
That thou dead corse again in complete steel
Revisitst thus the glimpses of the moon
Making night hideous and we fools of nature
So horridly to shake our disposition
With thoughts beyond the reaches of our souls
Say why is this wherefore what should we do
Ghost beckons HAMLET

HORATIO
It beckons you to go away with it
As if it some impartment did desire
To you alone
MARCELLUS
Look with what courteous action
It waves you to a more removed ground
But do not go with it
HORATIO
No by no means
HAMLET
It will not speak then I will follow it
HORATIO
Do not my lord
HAMLET
Why what should be the fear
I do not set my life in a pins fee
And for my soul what can it do to that
Being a thing immortal as itself
It waves me forth again Ill follow it
HORATIO
What if it tempt you toward the flood my lord
Or to the dreadful summit of the cliff
That beetles oer his base into the sea
And there assume some other horrible form
Which might deprive your sovereignty of reason
And draw you into madness think of it
The very place puts toys of desperation
Without more motive into every brain
That looks so many fathoms to the sea
And hears it roar beneath
HAMLET
It waves me still
Go on Ill follow thee
MARCELLUS
You shall not go my lord
HAMLET
Hold off your hands
HORATIO
Be ruled you shall not go
HAMLET
My fate cries out
And makes each petty artery in this body
As hardy as the Nemean lions nerve
Still am I calld Unhand me gentlemen
By heaven Ill make a ghost of him that lets me
I say away Go on Ill follow thee
Exeunt Ghost and HAMLET

HORATIO
He waxes desperate with imagination
MARCELLUS
Lets follow tis not fit thus to obey him
HORATIO
Have after To what issue will this come
MARCELLUS
Something is rotten in the state of Denmark
HORATIO
Heaven will direct it
MARCELLUS
Nay lets follow him
Exeunt

SCENE V Another part of the platform
Enter GHOST and HAMLET
HAMLET
Where wilt thou lead me speak Ill go no further
Ghost
Mark me
HAMLET
I will
Ghost
My hour is almost come
When I to sulphurous and tormenting flames
Must render up myself
HAMLET
Alas poor ghost
Ghost
Pity me not but lend thy serious hearing
To what I shall unfold
HAMLET
Speak I am bound to hear
Ghost
So art thou to revenge when thou shalt hear
HAMLET
What
Ghost
I am thy fathers spirit
Doomd for a certain term to walk the night
And for the day confined to fast in fires
Till the foul crimes done in my days of nature
Are burnt and purged away But that I am forbid
To tell the secrets of my prisonhouse
I could a tale unfold whose lightest word
Would harrow up thy soul freeze thy young blood
Make thy two eyes like stars start from their spheres
Thy knotted and combined locks to part
And each particular hair to stand on end
Like quills upon the fretful porpentine
But this eternal blazon must not be
To ears of flesh and blood List list O list
If thou didst ever thy dear father love
HAMLET
O God
Ghost
Revenge his foul and most unnatural murder
HAMLET
Murder
Ghost
Murder most foul as in the best it is
But this most foul strange and unnatural
HAMLET
Haste me to knowt that I with wings as swift
As meditation or the thoughts of love
May sweep to my revenge
Ghost
I find thee apt
And duller shouldst thou be than the fat weed
That roots itself in ease on Lethe wharf
Wouldst thou not stir in this Now Hamlet hear
Tis given out that sleeping in my orchard
A serpent stung me so the whole ear of Denmark
Is by a forged process of my death
Rankly abused but know thou noble youth
The serpent that did sting thy fathers life
Now wears his crown
HAMLET
O my prophetic soul My uncle
Ghost
Ay that incestuous that adulterate beast
With witchcraft of his wit with traitorous gifts
O wicked wit and gifts that have the power
So to seducewon to his shameful lust
The will of my most seemingvirtuous queen
O Hamlet what a fallingoff was there
From me whose love was of that dignity
That it went hand in hand even with the vow
I made to her in marriage and to decline
Upon a wretch whose natural gifts were poor
To those of mine
But virtue as it never will be moved
Though lewdness court it in a shape of heaven
So lust though to a radiant angel linkd
Will sate itself in a celestial bed
And prey on garbage
But soft methinks I scent the morning air
Brief let me be Sleeping within my orchard
My custom always of the afternoon
Upon my secure hour thy uncle stole
With juice of cursed hebenon in a vial
And in the porches of my ears did pour
The leperous distilment whose effect
Holds such an enmity with blood of man
That swift as quicksilver it courses through
The natural gates and alleys of the body
And with a sudden vigour doth posset
And curd like eager droppings into milk
The thin and wholesome blood so did it mine
And a most instant tetter barkd about
Most lazarlike with vile and loathsome crust
All my smooth body
Thus was I sleeping by a brothers hand
Of life of crown of queen at once dispatchd
Cut off even in the blossoms of my sin
Unhouseld disappointed unaneld
No reckoning made but sent to my account
With all my imperfections on my head
O horrible O horrible most horrible
If thou hast nature in thee bear it not
Let not the royal bed of Denmark be
A couch for luxury and damned incest
But howsoever thou pursuest this act
Taint not thy mind nor let thy soul contrive
Against thy mother aught leave her to heaven
And to those thorns that in her bosom lodge
To prick and sting her Fare thee well at once
The glowworm shows the matin to be near
And gins to pale his uneffectual fire
Adieu adieu Hamlet remember me
Exit

HAMLET
O all you host of heaven O earth what else
And shall I couple hell O fie Hold hold my heart
And you my sinews grow not instant old
But bear me stiffly up Remember thee
Ay thou poor ghost while memory holds a seat
In this distracted globe Remember thee
Yea from the table of my memory
Ill wipe away all trivial fond records
All saws of books all forms all pressures past
That youth and observation copied there
And thy commandment all alone shall live
Within the book and volume of my brain
Unmixd with baser matter yes by heaven
O most pernicious woman
O villain villain smiling damned villain
My tablesmeet it is I set it down
That one may smile and smile and be a villain
At least Im sure it may be so in Denmark
Writing

So uncle there you are Now to my word
It is Adieu adieu remember me
I have sworn t

That ever I was born to set it right
Nay come lets go together

ACT II
SCENE I A room in POLONIUS house
Enter POLONIUS and REYNALDO
LORD POLONIUS
Give him this money and these notes Reynaldo
REYNALDO
I will my lord
LORD POLONIUS
You shall do marvellous wisely good Reynaldo
Before you visit him to make inquire
Of his behavior
REYNALDO
My lord I did intend it
LORD POLONIUS
Marry well said very well said Look you sir
Inquire me first what Danskers are in Paris
And how and who what means and where they keep
What company at what expense and finding
By this encompassment and drift of question
That they do know my son come you more nearer
Than your particular demands will touch it
Take you as twere some distant knowledge of him
As thus I know his father and his friends
And in part him  do you mark this Reynaldo
REYNALDO
Ay very well my lord
LORD POLONIUS
And in part him but you may say not well
But ift be he I mean hes very wild
Addicted so and so and there put on him
What forgeries you please marry none so rank
As may dishonour him take heed of that
But sir such wanton wild and usual slips
As are companions noted and most known
To youth and liberty
REYNALDO
As gaming my lord
LORD POLONIUS
Ay or drinking fencing swearing quarrelling
Drabbing you may go so far
REYNALDO
My lord that would dishonour him
LORD POLONIUS
Faith no as you may season it in the charge
You must not put another scandal on him
That he is open to incontinency
Thats not my meaning but breathe his faults so quaintly
That they may seem the taints of liberty
The flash and outbreak of a fiery mind
A savageness in unreclaimed blood
Of general assault
REYNALDO
But my good lord
LORD POLONIUS
Wherefore should you do this
REYNALDO
Ay my lord
I would know that
LORD POLONIUS
Marry sir heres my drift
And I believe it is a fetch of wit
You laying these slight sullies on my son
As twere a thing a little soild i the working Mark you
Your party in converse him you would sound
Having ever seen in the prenominate crimes
The youth you breathe of guilty be assured
He closes with you in this consequence
Good sir or so or friend or gentleman
According to the phrase or the addition
Of man and country
REYNALDO
Very good my lord
LORD POLONIUS
And then sir does he thishe doeswhat was I
about to say By the mass I was about to say
something where did I leave
REYNALDO
At closes in the consequence at friend or so
and gentleman
LORD POLONIUS
At closes in the consequence ay marry
He closes thus I know the gentleman
I saw him yesterday or t other day
Or then or then with such or such and as you say
There was a gaming there oertook ins rouse
There falling out at tennis or perchance
I saw him enter such a house of sale
Videlicet a brothel or so forth
See you now
Your bait of falsehood takes this carp of truth
And thus do we of wisdom and of reach
With windlasses and with assays of bias
By indirections find directions out
So by my former lecture and advice
Shall you my son You have me have you not
REYNALDO
My lord I have
LORD POLONIUS
God be wi you fare you well
REYNALDO
Good my lord
LORD POLONIUS
Observe his inclination in yourself
REYNALDO
I shall my lord
LORD POLONIUS
And let him ply his music
REYNALDO
Well my lord
LORD POLONIUS
Farewell
Exit REYNALDO

Enter OPHELIA

How now Ophelia whats the matter
OPHELIA
O my lord my lord I have been so affrighted
LORD POLONIUS
With what i the name of God
OPHELIA
My lord as I was sewing in my closet
Lord Hamlet with his doublet all unbraced
No hat upon his head his stockings fould
Ungarterd and downgyved to his ancle
Pale as his shirt his knees knocking each other
And with a look so piteous in purport
As if he had been loosed out of hell
To speak of horrorshe comes before me
LORD POLONIUS
Mad for thy love
OPHELIA
My lord I do not know
But truly I do fear it
LORD POLONIUS
What said he
OPHELIA
He took me by the wrist and held me hard
Then goes he to the length of all his arm
And with his other hand thus oer his brow
He falls to such perusal of my face
As he would draw it Long stayd he so
At last a little shaking of mine arm
And thrice his head thus waving up and down
He raised a sigh so piteous and profound
As it did seem to shatter all his bulk
And end his being that done he lets me go
And with his head over his shoulder turnd
He seemd to find his way without his eyes
For out o doors he went without their helps
And to the last bended their light on me
LORD POLONIUS
Come go with me I will go seek the king
This is the very ecstasy of love
Whose violent property fordoes itself
And leads the will to desperate undertakings
As oft as any passion under heaven
That does afflict our natures I am sorry
What have you given him any hard words of late
OPHELIA
No my good lord but as you did command
I did repel his fetters and denied
His access to me
LORD POLONIUS
That hath made him mad
I am sorry that with better heed and judgment
I had not quoted him I feard he did but trifle
And meant to wreck thee but beshrew my jealousy
By heaven it is as proper to our age
To cast beyond ourselves in our opinions
As it is common for the younger sort
To lack discretion Come go we to the king
This must be known which being kept close might
move
More grief to hide than hate to utter love
Exeunt

SCENE II A room in the castle
Enter KING CLAUDIUS QUEEN GERTRUDE ROSENCRANTZ GUILDENSTERN and Attendants
KING CLAUDIUS
Welcome dear Rosencrantz and Guildenstern
Moreover that we much did long to see you
The need we have to use you did provoke
Our hasty sending Something have you heard
Of Hamlets transformation so call it
Sith nor the exterior nor the inward man
Resembles that it was What it should be
More than his fathers death that thus hath put him
So much from the understanding of himself
I cannot dream of I entreat you both
That being of so young days brought up with him
And sith so neighbourd to his youth and havior
That you vouchsafe your rest here in our court
Some little time so by your companies
To draw him on to pleasures and to gather
So much as from occasion you may glean
Whether aught to us unknown afflicts him thus
That opend lies within our remedy
QUEEN GERTRUDE
Good gentlemen he hath much talkd of you
And sure I am two men there are not living
To whom he more adheres If it will please you
To show us so much gentry and good will
As to expend your time with us awhile
For the supply and profit of our hope
Your visitation shall receive such thanks
As fits a kings remembrance
ROSENCRANTZ
Both your majesties
Might by the sovereign power you have of us
Put your dread pleasures more into command
Than to entreaty
GUILDENSTERN
But we both obey
And here give up ourselves in the full bent
To lay our service freely at your feet
To be commanded
KING CLAUDIUS
Thanks Rosencrantz and gentle Guildenstern
QUEEN GERTRUDE
Thanks Guildenstern and gentle Rosencrantz
And I beseech you instantly to visit
My too much changed son Go some of you
And bring these gentlemen where Hamlet is
GUILDENSTERN
Heavens make our presence and our practises
Pleasant and helpful to him
QUEEN GERTRUDE
Ay amen
Exeunt ROSENCRANTZ GUILDENSTERN and some Attendants

Enter POLONIUS

LORD POLONIUS
The ambassadors from Norway my good lord
Are joyfully returnd
KING CLAUDIUS
Thou still hast been the father of good news
LORD POLONIUS
Have I my lord I assure my good liege
I hold my duty as I hold my soul
Both to my God and to my gracious king
And I do think or else this brain of mine
Hunts not the trail of policy so sure
As it hath used to do that I have found
The very cause of Hamlets lunacy
KING CLAUDIUS
O speak of that that do I long to hear
LORD POLONIUS
Give first admittance to the ambassadors
My news shall be the fruit to that great feast
KING CLAUDIUS
Thyself do grace to them and bring them in
Exit POLONIUS

He tells me my dear Gertrude he hath found
The head and source of all your sons distemper
QUEEN GERTRUDE
I doubt it is no other but the main
His fathers death and our oerhasty marriage
KING CLAUDIUS
Well we shall sift him
Reenter POLONIUS with VOLTIMAND and CORNELIUS

Welcome my good friends
Say Voltimand what from our brother Norway
VOLTIMAND
Most fair return of greetings and desires
Upon our first he sent out to suppress
His nephews levies which to him appeard
To be a preparation gainst the Polack
But better lookd into he truly found
It was against your highness whereat grieved
That so his sickness age and impotence
Was falsely borne in hand sends out arrests
On Fortinbras which he in brief obeys
Receives rebuke from Norway and in fine
Makes vow before his uncle never more
To give the assay of arms against your majesty
Whereon old Norway overcome with joy
Gives him three thousand crowns in annual fee
And his commission to employ those soldiers
So levied as before against the Polack
With an entreaty herein further shown
Giving a paper

That it might please you to give quiet pass
Through your dominions for this enterprise
On such regards of safety and allowance
As therein are set down
KING CLAUDIUS
It likes us well
And at our more considerd time well read
Answer and think upon this business
Meantime we thank you for your welltook labour
Go to your rest at night well feast together
Most welcome home
Exeunt VOLTIMAND and CORNELIUS

LORD POLONIUS
This business is well ended
My liege and madam to expostulate
What majesty should be what duty is
Why day is day night night and time is time
Were nothing but to waste night day and time
Therefore since brevity is the soul of wit
And tediousness the limbs and outward flourishes
I will be brief your noble son is mad
Mad call I it for to define true madness
What ist but to be nothing else but mad
But let that go
QUEEN GERTRUDE
More matter with less art
LORD POLONIUS
Madam I swear I use no art at all
That he is mad tis true tis true tis pity
And pity tis tis true a foolish figure
But farewell it for I will use no art
Mad let us grant him then and now remains
That we find out the cause of this effect
Or rather say the cause of this defect
For this effect defective comes by cause
Thus it remains and the remainder thus Perpend
I have a daughterhave while she is mine
Who in her duty and obedience mark
Hath given me this now gather and surmise
Reads

To the celestial and my souls idol the most
beautified Ophelia
Thats an ill phrase a vile phrase beautified is
a vile phrase but you shall hear Thus
Reads

In her excellent white bosom these  c
QUEEN GERTRUDE
Came this from Hamlet to her
LORD POLONIUS
Good madam stay awhile I will be faithful
Reads

Doubt thou the stars are fire
Doubt that the sun doth move
Doubt truth to be a liar
But never doubt I love
O dear Ophelia I am ill at these numbers
I have not art to reckon my groans but that
I love thee best O most best believe it Adieu
Thine evermore most dear lady whilst
this machine is to him HAMLET
This in obedience hath my daughter shown me
And more above hath his solicitings
As they fell out by time by means and place
All given to mine ear
KING CLAUDIUS
But how hath she
Received his love
LORD POLONIUS
What do you think of me
KING CLAUDIUS
As of a man faithful and honourable
LORD POLONIUS
I would fain prove so But what might you think
When I had seen this hot love on the wing
As I perceived it I must tell you that
Before my daughter told mewhat might you
Or my dear majesty your queen here think
If I had playd the desk or tablebook
Or given my heart a winking mute and dumb
Or lookd upon this love with idle sight
What might you think No I went round to work
And my young mistress thus I did bespeak
Lord Hamlet is a prince out of thy star
This must not be and then I precepts gave her
That she should lock herself from his resort
Admit no messengers receive no tokens
Which done she took the fruits of my advice
And he repulseda short tale to make
Fell into a sadness then into a fast
Thence to a watch thence into a weakness
Thence to a lightness and by this declension
Into the madness wherein now he raves
And all we mourn for
KING CLAUDIUS
Do you think tis this
QUEEN GERTRUDE
It may be very likely
LORD POLONIUS
Hath there been such a timeId fain know that
That I have positively said Tis so
When it proved otherwise
KING CLAUDIUS
Not that I know
LORD POLONIUS
Pointing to his head and shoulder
Take this from this if this be otherwise
If circumstances lead me I will find
Where truth is hid though it were hid indeed
Within the centre
KING CLAUDIUS
How may we try it further
LORD POLONIUS
You know sometimes he walks four hours together
Here in the lobby
QUEEN GERTRUDE
So he does indeed
LORD POLONIUS
At such a time Ill loose my daughter to him
Be you and I behind an arras then
Mark the encounter if he love her not
And be not from his reason falln thereon
Let me be no assistant for a state
But keep a farm and carters
KING CLAUDIUS
We will try it
QUEEN GERTRUDE
But look where sadly the poor wretch comes reading
LORD POLONIUS
Away I do beseech you both away
Ill board him presently
Exeunt KING CLAUDIUS QUEEN GERTRUDE and Attendants

Enter HAMLET reading

O give me leave
How does my good Lord Hamlet
HAMLET
Well Godamercy
LORD POLONIUS
Do you know me my lord
HAMLET
Excellent well you are a fishmonger
LORD POLONIUS
Not I my lord
HAMLET
Then I would you were so honest a man
LORD POLONIUS
Honest my lord
HAMLET
Ay sir to be honest as this world goes is to be
one man picked out of ten thousand
LORD POLONIUS
Thats very true my lord
HAMLET
For if the sun breed maggots in a dead dog being a
god kissing carrionHave you a daughter
LORD POLONIUS
I have my lord
HAMLET
Let her not walk i the sun conception is a
blessing but not as your daughter may conceive
Friend look to t
LORD POLONIUS
Aside How say you by that Still harping on my
daughter yet he knew me not at first he said I
was a fishmonger he is far gone far gone and
truly in my youth I suffered much extremity for
love very near this Ill speak to him again
What do you read my lord
HAMLET
Words words words
LORD POLONIUS
What is the matter my lord
HAMLET
Between who
LORD POLONIUS
I mean the matter that you read my lord
HAMLET
Slanders sir for the satirical rogue says here
that old men have grey beards that their faces are
wrinkled their eyes purging thick amber and
plumtree gum and that they have a plentiful lack of
wit together with most weak hams all which sir
though I most powerfully and potently believe yet
I hold it not honesty to have it thus set down for
yourself sir should be old as I am if like a crab
you could go backward
LORD POLONIUS
Aside Though this be madness yet there is method
in t Will you walk out of the air my lord
HAMLET
Into my grave
LORD POLONIUS
Indeed that is out o the air
Aside

How pregnant sometimes his replies are a happiness
that often madness hits on which reason and sanity
could not so prosperously be delivered of I will
leave him and suddenly contrive the means of
meeting between him and my daughterMy honourable
lord I will most humbly take my leave of you
HAMLET
You cannot sir take from me any thing that I will
more willingly part withal except my life except
my life except my life
LORD POLONIUS
Fare you well my lord
HAMLET
These tedious old fools
Enter ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN

LORD POLONIUS
You go to seek the Lord Hamlet there he is
ROSENCRANTZ
To POLONIUS God save you sir
Exit POLONIUS

GUILDENSTERN
My honoured lord
ROSENCRANTZ
My most dear lord
HAMLET
My excellent good friends How dost thou
Guildenstern Ah Rosencrantz Good lads how do ye both
ROSENCRANTZ
As the indifferent children of the earth
GUILDENSTERN
Happy in that we are not overhappy
On fortunes cap we are not the very button
HAMLET
Nor the soles of her shoe
ROSENCRANTZ
Neither my lord
HAMLET
Then you live about her waist or in the middle of
her favours
GUILDENSTERN
Faith her privates we
HAMLET
In the secret parts of fortune O most true she
is a strumpet Whats the news
ROSENCRANTZ
None my lord but that the worlds grown honest
HAMLET
Then is doomsday near but your news is not true
Let me question more in particular what have you
my good friends deserved at the hands of fortune
that she sends you to prison hither
GUILDENSTERN
Prison my lord
HAMLET
Denmarks a prison
ROSENCRANTZ
Then is the world one
HAMLET
A goodly one in which there are many confines
wards and dungeons Denmark being one o the worst
ROSENCRANTZ
We think not so my lord
HAMLET
Why then tis none to you for there is nothing
either good or bad but thinking makes it so to me
it is a prison
ROSENCRANTZ
Why then your ambition makes it one tis too
narrow for your mind
HAMLET
O God I could be bounded in a nut shell and count
myself a king of infinite space were it not that I
have bad dreams
GUILDENSTERN
Which dreams indeed are ambition for the very
substance of the ambitious is merely the shadow of a dream
HAMLET
A dream itself is but a shadow
ROSENCRANTZ
Truly and I hold ambition of so airy and light a
quality that it is but a shadows shadow
HAMLET
Then are our beggars bodies and our monarchs and
outstretched heroes the beggars shadows Shall we
to the court for by my fay I cannot reason
ROSENCRANTZ GUILDENSTERN
Well wait upon you
HAMLET
No such matter I will not sort you with the rest
of my servants for to speak to you like an honest
man I am most dreadfully attended But in the
beaten way of friendship what make you at Elsinore
ROSENCRANTZ
To visit you my lord no other occasion
HAMLET
Beggar that I am I am even poor in thanks but I
thank you and sure dear friends my thanks are
too dear a halfpenny Were you not sent for Is it
your own inclining Is it a free visitation Come
deal justly with me come come nay speak
GUILDENSTERN
What should we say my lord
HAMLET
Why any thing but to the purpose You were sent
for and there is a kind of confession in your looks
which your modesties have not craft enough to colour
I know the good king and queen have sent for you
ROSENCRANTZ
To what end my lord
HAMLET
That you must teach me But let me conjure you by
the rights of our fellowship by the consonancy of
our youth by the obligation of our everpreserved
love and by what more dear a better proposer could
charge you withal be even and direct with me
whether you were sent for or no
ROSENCRANTZ
Aside to GUILDENSTERN What say you
HAMLET
Aside Nay then I have an eye of youIf you
love me hold not off
GUILDENSTERN
My lord we were sent for
HAMLET
I will tell you why so shall my anticipation
prevent your discovery and your secrecy to the king
and queen moult no feather I have of latebut
wherefore I know notlost all my mirth forgone all
custom of exercises and indeed it goes so heavily
with my disposition that this goodly frame the
earth seems to me a sterile promontory this most
excellent canopy the air look you this brave
oerhanging firmament this majestical roof fretted
with golden fire why it appears no other thing to
me than a foul and pestilent congregation of vapours
What a piece of work is a man how noble in reason
how infinite in faculty in form and moving how
express and admirable in action how like an angel
in apprehension how like a god the beauty of the
world the paragon of animals And yet to me
what is this quintessence of dust man delights not
me no nor woman neither though by your smiling
you seem to say so
ROSENCRANTZ
My lord there was no such stuff in my thoughts
HAMLET
Why did you laugh then when I said man delights not me
ROSENCRANTZ
To think my lord if you delight not in man what
lenten entertainment the players shall receive from
you we coted them on the way and hither are they
coming to offer you service
HAMLET
He that plays the king shall be welcome his majesty
shall have tribute of me the adventurous knight
shall use his foil and target the lover shall not
sigh gratis the humourous man shall end his part
in peace the clown shall make those laugh whose
lungs are tickled o the sere and the lady shall
say her mind freely or the blank verse shall halt
fort What players are they
ROSENCRANTZ
Even those you were wont to take delight in the
tragedians of the city
HAMLET
How chances it they travel their residence both
in reputation and profit was better both ways
ROSENCRANTZ
I think their inhibition comes by the means of the
late innovation
HAMLET
Do they hold the same estimation they did when I was
in the city are they so followed
ROSENCRANTZ
No indeed are they not
HAMLET
How comes it do they grow rusty
ROSENCRANTZ
Nay their endeavour keeps in the wonted pace but
there is sir an aery of children little eyases
that cry out on the top of question and are most
tyrannically clapped fort these are now the
fashion and so berattle the common stagesso they
call themthat many wearing rapiers are afraid of
goosequills and dare scarce come thither
HAMLET
What are they children who maintains em how are
they escoted Will they pursue the quality no
longer than they can sing will they not say
afterwards if they should grow themselves to common
playersas it is most like if their means are no
bettertheir writers do them wrong to make them
exclaim against their own succession
ROSENCRANTZ
Faith there has been much to do on both sides and
the nation holds it no sin to tarre them to
controversy there was for a while no money bid
for argument unless the poet and the player went to
cuffs in the question
HAMLET
Ist possible
GUILDENSTERN
O there has been much throwing about of brains
HAMLET
Do the boys carry it away
ROSENCRANTZ
Ay that they do my lord Hercules and his load too
HAMLET
It is not very strange for mine uncle is king of
Denmark and those that would make mows at him while
my father lived give twenty forty fifty an
hundred ducats apiece for his picture in little
Sblood there is something in this more than
natural if philosophy could find it out
Flourish of trumpets within

GUILDENSTERN
There are the players
HAMLET
Gentlemen you are welcome to Elsinore Your hands
come then the appurtenance of welcome is fashion
and ceremony let me comply with you in this garb

Enter four or five Players

You are welcome masters welcome all I am glad
to see thee well Welcome good friends O my old
friend thy face is valenced since I saw thee last
comest thou to beard me in Denmark What my young
lady and mistress Byr lady your ladyship is
nearer to heaven than when I saw you last by the
altitude of a chopine Pray God your voice like
apiece of uncurrent gold be not cracked within the
ring Masters you are all welcome Well een
tot like French falconers fly at any thing we see
well have a speech straight come give us a taste
of your quality come a passionate speech
First Player
What speech my lord
HAMLET
I heard thee speak me a speech once but it was
never acted or if it was not above once for the
play I remember pleased not the million twas
caviare to the general but it wasas I received
it and others whose judgments in such matters
cried in the top of minean excellent play well
digested in the scenes set down with as much
modesty as cunning I remember one said there
were no sallets in the lines to make the matter
savoury nor no matter in the phrase that might
indict the author of affectation but called it an
honest method as wholesome as sweet and by very
much more handsome than fine One speech in it I
chiefly loved twas Aeneas tale to Dido and
thereabout of it especially where he speaks of
Priams slaughter if it live in your memory begin
at this line let me see let me see
The rugged Pyrrhus like the Hyrcanian beast
it is not soit begins with Pyrrhus
The rugged Pyrrhus he whose sable arms
Black as his purpose did the night resemble
When he lay couched in the ominous horse
Hath now this dread and black complexion smeard
With heraldry more dismal head to foot
Now is he total gules horridly trickd
With blood of fathers mothers daughters sons
Baked and impasted with the parching streets
That lend a tyrannous and damned light
To their lords murder roasted in wrath and fire
And thus oersized with coagulate gore
With eyes like carbuncles the hellish Pyrrhus
Old grandsire Priam seeks
So proceed you
LORD POLONIUS
Fore God my lord well spoken with good accent and
good discretion
First Player
Anon he finds him
Striking too short at Greeks his antique sword
Rebellious to his arm lies where it falls
Repugnant to command unequal matchd
Pyrrhus at Priam drives in rage strikes wide
But with the whiff and wind of his fell sword
The unnerved father falls Then senseless Ilium
Seeming to feel this blow with flaming top
Stoops to his base and with a hideous crash
Takes prisoner Pyrrhus ear for lo his sword
Which was declining on the milky head
Of reverend Priam seemd i the air to stick
So as a painted tyrant Pyrrhus stood
And like a neutral to his will and matter
Did nothing
But as we often see against some storm
A silence in the heavens the rack stand still
The bold winds speechless and the orb below
As hush as death anon the dreadful thunder
Doth rend the region so after Pyrrhus pause
Aroused vengeance sets him new awork
And never did the Cyclops hammers fall
On Marss armour forged for proof eterne
With less remorse than Pyrrhus bleeding sword
Now falls on Priam
Out out thou strumpet Fortune All you gods
In general synod take away her power
Break all the spokes and fellies from her wheel
And bowl the round nave down the hill of heaven
As low as to the fiends
LORD POLONIUS
This is too long
HAMLET
It shall to the barbers with your beard Prithee
say on hes for a jig or a tale of bawdry or he
sleeps say on come to Hecuba
First Player
But who O who had seen the mobled queen
HAMLET
The mobled queen
LORD POLONIUS
Thats good mobled queen is good
First Player
Run barefoot up and down threatening the flames
With bisson rheum a clout upon that head
Where late the diadem stood and for a robe
About her lank and all oerteemed loins
A blanket in the alarm of fear caught up
Who this had seen with tongue in venom steepd
Gainst Fortunes state would treason have
pronounced
But if the gods themselves did see her then
When she saw Pyrrhus make malicious sport
In mincing with his sword her husbands limbs
The instant burst of clamour that she made
Unless things mortal move them not at all
Would have made milch the burning eyes of heaven
And passion in the gods
LORD POLONIUS
Look whether he has not turned his colour and has
tears ins eyes Pray you no more
HAMLET
Tis well Ill have thee speak out the rest soon
Good my lord will you see the players well
bestowed Do you hear let them be well used for
they are the abstract and brief chronicles of the
time after your death you were better have a bad
epitaph than their ill report while you live
LORD POLONIUS
My lord I will use them according to their desert
HAMLET
Gods bodykins man much better use every man
after his desert and who should scape whipping
Use them after your own honour and dignity the less
they deserve the more merit is in your bounty
Take them in
LORD POLONIUS
Come sirs
HAMLET
Follow him friends well hear a play tomorrow
Exit POLONIUS with all the Players but the First

Dost thou hear me old friend can you play the
Murder of Gonzago
First Player
Ay my lord
HAMLET
Well hat tomorrow night You could for a need
study a speech of some dozen or sixteen lines which
I would set down and insert int could you not
First Player
Ay my lord
HAMLET
Very well Follow that lord and look you mock him
not
Exit First Player

My good friends Ill leave you till night you are
welcome to Elsinore
ROSENCRANTZ
Good my lord
HAMLET
Ay so God be wi ye
Exeunt ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN

Now I am alone
O what a rogue and peasant slave am I
Is it not monstrous that this player here
But in a fiction in a dream of passion
Could force his soul so to his own conceit
That from her working all his visage wannd
Tears in his eyes distraction ins aspect
A broken voice and his whole function suiting
With forms to his conceit and all for nothing
For Hecuba
Whats Hecuba to him or he to Hecuba
That he should weep for her What would he do
Had he the motive and the cue for passion
That I have He would drown the stage with tears
And cleave the general ear with horrid speech
Make mad the guilty and appal the free
Confound the ignorant and amaze indeed
The very faculties of eyes and ears Yet I
A dull and muddymettled rascal peak
Like Johnadreams unpregnant of my cause
And can say nothing no not for a king
Upon whose property and most dear life
A damnd defeat was made Am I a coward
Who calls me villain breaks my pate across
Plucks off my beard and blows it in my face
Tweaks me by the nose gives me the lie i the throat
As deep as to the lungs who does me this
Ha
Swounds I should take it for it cannot be
But I am pigeonliverd and lack gall
To make oppression bitter or ere this
I should have fatted all the region kites
With this slaves offal bloody bawdy villain
Remorseless treacherous lecherous kindless villain
O vengeance
Why what an ass am I This is most brave
That I the son of a dear father murderd
Prompted to my revenge by heaven and hell
Must like a whore unpack my heart with words
And fall acursing like a very drab
A scullion
Fie upont foh About my brain I have heard
That guilty creatures sitting at a play
Have by the very cunning of the scene
Been struck so to the soul that presently
They have proclaimd their malefactions
For murder though it have no tongue will speak
With most miraculous organ Ill have these players
Play something like the murder of my father
Before mine uncle Ill observe his looks
Ill tent him to the quick if he but blench
I know my course The spirit that I have seen
May be the devil and the devil hath power
To assume a pleasing shape yea and perhaps
Out of my weakness and my melancholy
As he is very potent with such spirits
Abuses me to damn me Ill have grounds
More relative than this the play s the thing
Wherein Ill catch the conscience of the king

ACT III
SCENE I A room in the castle
Enter KING CLAUDIUS QUEEN GERTRUDE POLONIUS OPHELIA ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN
KING CLAUDIUS
And can you by no drift of circumstance
Get from him why he puts on this confusion
Grating so harshly all his days of quiet
With turbulent and dangerous lunacy
ROSENCRANTZ
He does confess he feels himself distracted
But from what cause he will by no means speak
GUILDENSTERN
Nor do we find him forward to be sounded
But with a crafty madness keeps aloof
When we would bring him on to some confession
Of his true state
QUEEN GERTRUDE
Did he receive you well
ROSENCRANTZ
Most like a gentleman
GUILDENSTERN
But with much forcing of his disposition
ROSENCRANTZ
Niggard of question but of our demands
Most free in his reply
QUEEN GERTRUDE
Did you assay him
To any pastime
ROSENCRANTZ
Madam it so fell out that certain players
We oerraught on the way of these we told him
And there did seem in him a kind of joy
To hear of it they are about the court
And as I think they have already order
This night to play before him
LORD POLONIUS
Tis most true
And he beseechd me to entreat your majesties
To hear and see the matter
KING CLAUDIUS
With all my heart and it doth much content me
To hear him so inclined
Good gentlemen give him a further edge
And drive his purpose on to these delights
ROSENCRANTZ
We shall my lord
Exeunt ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN

KING CLAUDIUS
Sweet Gertrude leave us too
For we have closely sent for Hamlet hither
That he as twere by accident may here
Affront Ophelia
Her father and myself lawful espials
Will so bestow ourselves that seeing unseen
We may of their encounter frankly judge
And gather by him as he is behaved
If t be the affliction of his love or no
That thus he suffers for
QUEEN GERTRUDE
I shall obey you
And for your part Ophelia I do wish
That your good beauties be the happy cause
Of Hamlets wildness so shall I hope your virtues
Will bring him to his wonted way again
To both your honours
OPHELIA
Madam I wish it may
Exit QUEEN GERTRUDE

LORD POLONIUS
Ophelia walk you here Gracious so please you
We will bestow ourselves
To OPHELIA

Read on this book
That show of such an exercise may colour
Your loneliness We are oft to blame in this
Tis too much provedthat with devotions visage
And pious action we do sugar oer
The devil himself
KING CLAUDIUS
Aside O tis too true
How smart a lash that speech doth give my conscience
The harlots cheek beautied with plastering art
Is not more ugly to the thing that helps it
Than is my deed to my most painted word
O heavy burthen
LORD POLONIUS
I hear him coming lets withdraw my lord
Exeunt KING CLAUDIUS and POLONIUS

Enter HAMLET

HAMLET
To be or not to be that is the question
Whether tis nobler in the mind to suffer
The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune
Or to take arms against a sea of troubles
And by opposing end them To die to sleep
No more and by a sleep to say we end
The heartache and the thousand natural shocks
That flesh is heir to tis a consummation
Devoutly to be wishd To die to sleep
To sleep perchance to dream ay theres the rub
For in that sleep of death what dreams may come
When we have shuffled off this mortal coil
Must give us pause theres the respect
That makes calamity of so long life
For who would bear the whips and scorns of time
The oppressors wrong the proud mans contumely
The pangs of despised love the laws delay
The insolence of office and the spurns
That patient merit of the unworthy takes
When he himself might his quietus make
With a bare bodkin who would fardels bear
To grunt and sweat under a weary life
But that the dread of something after death
The undiscoverd country from whose bourn
No traveller returns puzzles the will
And makes us rather bear those ills we have
Than fly to others that we know not of
Thus conscience does make cowards of us all
And thus the native hue of resolution
Is sicklied oer with the pale cast of thought
And enterprises of great pith and moment
With this regard their currents turn awry
And lose the name of actionSoft you now
The fair Ophelia Nymph in thy orisons
Be all my sins rememberd
OPHELIA
Good my lord
How does your honour for this many a day
HAMLET
I humbly thank you well well well
OPHELIA
My lord I have remembrances of yours
That I have longed long to redeliver
I pray you now receive them
HAMLET
No not I
I never gave you aught
OPHELIA
My honourd lord you know right well you did
And with them words of so sweet breath composed
As made the things more rich their perfume lost
Take these again for to the noble mind
Rich gifts wax poor when givers prove unkind
There my lord
HAMLET
Ha ha are you honest
OPHELIA
My lord
HAMLET
Are you fair
OPHELIA
What means your lordship
HAMLET
That if you be honest and fair your honesty should
admit no discourse to your beauty
OPHELIA
Could beauty my lord have better commerce than
with honesty
HAMLET
Ay truly for the power of beauty will sooner
transform honesty from what it is to a bawd than the
force of honesty can translate beauty into his
likeness this was sometime a paradox but now the
time gives it proof I did love you once
OPHELIA
Indeed my lord you made me believe so
HAMLET
You should not have believed me for virtue cannot
so inoculate our old stock but we shall relish of
it I loved you not
OPHELIA
I was the more deceived
HAMLET
Get thee to a nunnery why wouldst thou be a
breeder of sinners I am myself indifferent honest
but yet I could accuse me of such things that it
were better my mother had not borne me I am very
proud revengeful ambitious with more offences at
my beck than I have thoughts to put them in
imagination to give them shape or time to act them
in What should such fellows as I do crawling
between earth and heaven We are arrant knaves
all believe none of us Go thy ways to a nunnery
Wheres your father
OPHELIA
At home my lord
HAMLET
Let the doors be shut upon him that he may play the
fool no where but ins own house Farewell
OPHELIA
O help him you sweet heavens
HAMLET
If thou dost marry Ill give thee this plague for
thy dowry be thou as chaste as ice as pure as
snow thou shalt not escape calumny Get thee to a
nunnery go farewell Or if thou wilt needs
marry marry a fool for wise men know well enough
what monsters you make of them To a nunnery go
and quickly too Farewell
OPHELIA
O heavenly powers restore him
HAMLET
I have heard of your paintings too well enough God
has given you one face and you make yourselves
another you jig you amble and you lisp and
nickname Gods creatures and make your wantonness
your ignorance Go to Ill no more ont it hath
made me mad I say we will have no more marriages
those that are married already all but one shall
live the rest shall keep as they are To a
nunnery go
Exit

OPHELIA
O what a noble mind is here oerthrown
The courtiers soldiers scholars eye tongue sword
The expectancy and rose of the fair state
The glass of fashion and the mould of form
The observed of all observers quite quite down
And I of ladies most deject and wretched
That suckd the honey of his music vows
Now see that noble and most sovereign reason
Like sweet bells jangled out of tune and harsh
That unmatchd form and feature of blown youth
Blasted with ecstasy O woe is me
To have seen what I have seen see what I see
Reenter KING CLAUDIUS and POLONIUS

KING CLAUDIUS
Love his affections do not that way tend
Nor what he spake though it lackd form a little
Was not like madness Theres something in his soul
Oer which his melancholy sits on brood
And I do doubt the hatch and the disclose
Will be some danger which for to prevent
I have in quick determination
Thus set it down he shall with speed to England
For the demand of our neglected tribute
Haply the seas and countries different
With variable objects shall expel
This somethingsettled matter in his heart
Whereon his brains still beating puts him thus
From fashion of himself What think you ont
LORD POLONIUS
It shall do well but yet do I believe
The origin and commencement of his grief
Sprung from neglected love How now Ophelia
You need not tell us what Lord Hamlet said
We heard it all My lord do as you please
But if you hold it fit after the play
Let his queen mother all alone entreat him
To show his grief let her be round with him
And Ill be placed so please you in the ear
Of all their conference If she find him not
To England send him or confine him where
Your wisdom best shall think
KING CLAUDIUS
It shall be so
Madness in great ones must not unwatchd go
Exeunt

SCENE II A hall in the castle
Enter HAMLET and Players
HAMLET
Speak the speech I pray you as I pronounced it to
you trippingly on the tongue but if you mouth it
as many of your players do I had as lief the
towncrier spoke my lines Nor do not saw the air
too much with your hand thus but use all gently
for in the very torrent tempest and as I may say
the whirlwind of passion you must acquire and beget
a temperance that may give it smoothness O it
offends me to the soul to hear a robustious
periwigpated fellow tear a passion to tatters to
very rags to split the ears of the groundlings who
for the most part are capable of nothing but
inexplicable dumbshows and noise I would have such
a fellow whipped for oerdoing Termagant it
outherods Herod pray you avoid it
First Player
I warrant your honour
HAMLET
Be not too tame neither but let your own discretion
be your tutor suit the action to the word the
word to the action with this special oerstep not
the modesty of nature for any thing so overdone is
from the purpose of playing whose end both at the
first and now was and is to hold as twere the
mirror up to nature to show virtue her own feature
scorn her own image and the very age and body of
the time his form and pressure Now this overdone
or come tardy off though it make the unskilful
laugh cannot but make the judicious grieve the
censure of the which one must in your allowance
oerweigh a whole theatre of others O there be
players that I have seen play and heard others
praise and that highly not to speak it profanely
that neither having the accent of Christians nor
the gait of Christian pagan nor man have so
strutted and bellowed that I have thought some of
natures journeymen had made men and not made them
well they imitated humanity so abominably
First Player
I hope we have reformed that indifferently with us
sir
HAMLET
O reform it altogether And let those that play
your clowns speak no more than is set down for them
for there be of them that will themselves laugh to
set on some quantity of barren spectators to laugh
too though in the mean time some necessary
question of the play be then to be considered
thats villanous and shows a most pitiful ambition
in the fool that uses it Go make you ready
Exeunt Players

Enter POLONIUS ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN

Enter HORATIO

HORATIO
Here sweet lord at your service
HAMLET
Horatio thou art een as just a man
As eer my conversation coped withal
HORATIO
O my dear lord
HAMLET
Nay do not think I flatter
For what advancement may I hope from thee
That no revenue hast but thy good spirits
To feed and clothe thee Why should the poor be flatterd
No let the candied tongue lick absurd pomp
And crook the pregnant hinges of the knee
Where thrift may follow fawning Dost thou hear
Since my dear soul was mistress of her choice
And could of men distinguish her election
Hath seald thee for herself for thou hast been
As one in suffering all that suffers nothing
A man that fortunes buffets and rewards
Hast taen with equal thanks and blest are those
Whose blood and judgment are so well commingled
That they are not a pipe for fortunes finger
To sound what stop she please Give me that man
That is not passions slave and I will wear him
In my hearts core ay in my heart of heart
As I do theeSomething too much of this
There is a play tonight before the king
One scene of it comes near the circumstance
Which I have told thee of my fathers death
I prithee when thou seest that act afoot
Even with the very comment of thy soul
Observe mine uncle if his occulted guilt
Do not itself unkennel in one speech
It is a damned ghost that we have seen
And my imaginations are as foul
As Vulcans stithy Give him heedful note
For I mine eyes will rivet to his face
And after we will both our judgments join
In censure of his seeming
HORATIO
Well my lord
If he steal aught the whilst this play is playing
And scape detecting I will pay the theft
HAMLET
They are coming to the play I must be idle
Get you a place

OPHELIA
Will he tell us what this show meant
HAMLET
Ay or any show that youll show him be not you

Here stooping to your clemency
We beg your hearing patiently
Exit

HAMLET
Is this a prologue or the posy of a ring
OPHELIA
Tis brief my lord
HAMLET
As womans love
Enter two Players King and Queen

Player King
Full thirty times hath Phoebus cart gone round
Neptunes salt wash and Tellus orbed ground
And thirty dozen moons with borrowd sheen
About the world have times twelve thirties been
Since love our hearts and Hymen did our hands
Unite commutual in most sacred bands
Player Queen
So many journeys may the sun and moon
Make us again count oer ere love be done
But woe is me you are so sick of late
So far from cheer and from your former state
That I distrust you Yet though I distrust
Discomfort you my lord it nothing must
For womens fear and love holds quantity
In neither aught or in extremity
Now what my love is proof hath made you know
And as my love is sized my fear is so
Where love is great the littlest doubts are fear
Where little fears grow great great love grows there
Player King
Faith I must leave thee love and shortly too
My operant powers their functions leave to do
And thou shalt live in this fair world behind
Honourd beloved and haply one as kind
For husband shalt thou
Player Queen
O confound the rest
Such love must needs be treason in my breast
In second husband let me be accurst
None wed the second but who killd the first
HAMLET
Aside Wormwood wormwood
Player Queen
The instances that second marriage move
Are base respects of thrift but none of love
A second time I kill my husband dead
When second husband kisses me in bed
Player King
I do believe you think what now you speak
But what we do determine oft we break
Purpose is but the slave to memory
Of violent birth but poor validity
Which now like fruit unripe sticks on the tree
But fall unshaken when they mellow be
Most necessary tis that we forget
To pay ourselves what to ourselves is debt
What to ourselves in passion we propose
The passion ending doth the purpose lose
The violence of either grief or joy
Their own enactures with themselves destroy
Where joy most revels grief doth most lament
Grief joys joy grieves on slender accident
This world is not for aye nor tis not strange
That even our loves should with our fortunes change
For tis a question left us yet to prove
Whether love lead fortune or else fortune love
The great man down you mark his favourite flies
The poor advanced makes friends of enemies
And hitherto doth love on fortune tend
For who not needs shall never lack a friend
And who in want a hollow friend doth try
Directly seasons him his enemy
But orderly to end where I begun
Our wills and fates do so contrary run
That our devices still are overthrown
Our thoughts are ours their ends none of our own
So think thou wilt no second husband wed
But die thy thoughts when thy first lord is dead
Player Queen
Nor earth to me give food nor heaven light
Sport and repose lock from me day and night
To desperation turn my trust and hope
An anchors cheer in prison be my scope
Each opposite that blanks the face of joy
Meet what I would have well and it destroy
Both here and hence pursue me lasting strife
If once a widow ever I be wife
HAMLET
If she should break it now
Player King
Tis deeply sworn Sweet leave me here awhile
My spirits grow dull and fain I would beguile
The tedious day with sleep
Sleeps

Player Queen
Sleep rock thy brain
And never come mischance between us twain
Exit

HAMLET
Madam how like you this play
QUEEN GERTRUDE
The lady protests too much methinks
HAMLET
O but shell keep her word
KING CLAUDIUS
Have you heard the argument Is there no offence in t
HAMLET
No no they do but jest poison in jest no offence
i the world
KING CLAUDIUS
What do you call the play
HAMLET
The Mousetrap Marry how Tropically This play
is the image of a murder done in Vienna Gonzago is
the dukes name his wife Baptista you shall see
anon tis a knavish piece of work but what o
that your majesty and we that have free souls it
touches us not let the galled jade wince our
withers are unwrung
Enter LUCIANUS

This is one Lucianus nephew to the king
OPHELIA
You are as good as a chorus my lord
HAMLET
I could interpret between you and your love if I
could see the puppets dallying
OPHELIA
You are keen my lord you are keen
HAMLET
It would cost you a groaning to take off my edge
OPHELIA
Still better and worse

Provincial roses on my razed shoes get me a

The king sir
HAMLET
Ay sir what of him
GUILDENSTERN
Is in his retirement marvellous distempered
HAMLET
With drink sir
GUILDENSTERN
No my lord rather with choler
HAMLET
Your wisdom should show itself more richer to
signify this to his doctor for for me to put him
to his purgation would perhaps plunge him into far
more choler
GUILDENSTERN
Good my lord put your discourse into some frame and
start not so wildly from my affair
HAMLET
I am tame sir pronounce
GUILDENSTERN
The queen your mother in most great affliction of
spirit hath sent me to you

breed If it shall please you to make me a
wholesome answer I will do your mothers
commandment if not your pardon and my return

HAMLET
Sir I cannot
GUILDENSTERN

HAMLET
Make you a wholesome answer my wits diseased but
sir such answer as I can make you shall command

more but to the matter my mother you say
ROSENCRANTZ
Then thus she says your behavior hath struck her
into amazement and admiration
HAMLET
O wonderful son that can so astonish a mother But
is there no sequel at the heels of this mothers
admiration Impart
ROSENCRANTZ
She desires to speak with you in her closet ere you
go to bed
HAMLET
We shall obey were she ten times our mother Have

ROSENCRANTZ
My lord you once did love me
HAMLET
So I do still by these pickers and stealers
ROSENCRANTZ
Good my lord what is your cause of distemper you
do surely bar the door upon your own liberty if
you deny your griefs to your friend
HAMLET
Sir I lack advancement
ROSENCRANTZ
How can that be when you have the voice of the king
himself for your succession in Denmark
HAMLET
Ay but sir While the grass growsthe proverb
is something musty
Reenter Players with recorders

your lingers and thumb give it breath with your
mouth and it will discourse most eloquent music
Look you these are the stops
GUILDENSTERN
But these cannot I command to any utterance of
harmony I have not the skill
HAMLET
Why look you now how unworthy a thing you make of
me You would play upon me you would seem to know
my stops you would pluck out the heart of my
mystery you would sound me from my lowest note to
the top of my compass and there is much music

cannot play upon me
Enter POLONIUS

LORD POLONIUS

HAMLET
By and by is easily said
Exit POLONIUS

Leave me friends
Exeunt all but HAMLET

Tis now the very witching time of night
When churchyards yawn and hell itself breathes out
Contagion to this world now could I drink hot blood
And do such bitter business as the day
Would quake to look on Soft now to my mother
O heart lose not thy nature let not ever
The soul of Nero enter this firm bosom
Let me be cruel not unnatural
I will speak daggers to her but use none
My tongue and soul in this be hypocrites
How in my words soever she be shent
To give them seals never my soul consent
Exit

SCENE III A room in the castle
Enter KING CLAUDIUS ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN
KING CLAUDIUS
I like him not nor stands it safe with us
To let his madness range Therefore prepare you
I your commission will forthwith dispatch
And he to England shall along with you
The terms of our estate may not endure
Hazard so dangerous as doth hourly grow
Out of his lunacies
GUILDENSTERN
We will ourselves provide
Most holy and religious fear it is
To keep those many many bodies safe
That live and feed upon your majesty
ROSENCRANTZ
The single and peculiar life is bound
With all the strength and armour of the mind
To keep itself from noyance but much more
That spirit upon whose weal depend and rest
The lives of many The cease of majesty
Dies not alone but like a gulf doth draw
Whats near it with it it is a massy wheel
Fixd on the summit of the highest mount
To whose huge spokes ten thousand lesser things
Are mortised and adjoind which when it falls
Each small annexment petty consequence
Attends the boisterous ruin Never alone
Did the king sigh but with a general groan
KING CLAUDIUS
Arm you I pray you to this speedy voyage
For we will fetters put upon this fear
Which now goes too freefooted
ROSENCRANTZ GUILDENSTERN
We will haste us
Exeunt ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN

Enter POLONIUS

LORD POLONIUS
My lord hes going to his mothers closet
Behind the arras Ill convey myself
To hear the process and warrant shell tax him home
And as you said and wisely was it said
Tis meet that some more audience than a mother
Since nature makes them partial should oerhear
The speech of vantage Fare you well my liege
Ill call upon you ere you go to bed
And tell you what I know
KING CLAUDIUS
Thanks dear my lord
Exit POLONIUS

O my offence is rank it smells to heaven
It hath the primal eldest curse upont
A brothers murder Pray can I not
Though inclination be as sharp as will
My stronger guilt defeats my strong intent
And like a man to double business bound
I stand in pause where I shall first begin
And both neglect What if this cursed hand
Were thicker than itself with brothers blood
Is there not rain enough in the sweet heavens
To wash it white as snow Whereto serves mercy
But to confront the visage of offence
And whats in prayer but this twofold force
To be forestalled ere we come to fall
Or pardond being down Then Ill look up
My fault is past But O what form of prayer
Can serve my turn Forgive me my foul murder
That cannot be since I am still possessd
Of those effects for which I did the murder
My crown mine own ambition and my queen
May one be pardond and retain the offence
In the corrupted currents of this world
Offences gilded hand may shove by justice
And oft tis seen the wicked prize itself
Buys out the law but tis not so above
There is no shuffling there the action lies
In his true nature and we ourselves compelld
Even to the teeth and forehead of our faults
To give in evidence What then what rests
Try what repentance can what can it not
Yet what can it when one can not repent
O wretched state O bosom black as death
O limed soul that struggling to be free
Art more engaged Help angels Make assay
Bow stubborn knees and heart with strings of steel
Be soft as sinews of the newborn babe
All may be well
Retires and kneels

Enter HAMLET

HAMLET
Now might I do it pat now he is praying
And now Ill dot And so he goes to heaven
And so am I revenged That would be scannd
A villain kills my father and for that
I his sole son do this same villain send
To heaven
O this is hire and salary not revenge
He took my father grossly full of bread
With all his crimes broad blown as flush as May
And how his audit stands who knows save heaven
But in our circumstance and course of thought
Tis heavy with him and am I then revenged
To take him in the purging of his soul
When he is fit and seasond for his passage
No
Up sword and know thou a more horrid hent
When he is drunk asleep or in his rage
Or in the incestuous pleasure of his bed
At gaming swearing or about some act
That has no relish of salvation int
Then trip him that his heels may kick at heaven
And that his soul may be as damnd and black
As hell whereto it goes My mother stays
This physic but prolongs thy sickly days
Exit

KING CLAUDIUS
Rising My words fly up my thoughts remain below
Words without thoughts never to heaven go
Exit

SCENE IV The Queens closet
Enter QUEEN GERTRUDE and POLONIUS
LORD POLONIUS
He will come straight Look you lay home to him
Tell him his pranks have been too broad to bear with
And that your grace hath screend and stood between
Much heat and him Ill sconce me even here
Pray you be round with him
HAMLET
Within Mother mother mother
QUEEN GERTRUDE
Ill warrant you
Fear me not withdraw I hear him coming
POLONIUS hides behind the arras

Enter HAMLET

HAMLET
Now mother whats the matter
QUEEN GERTRUDE
Hamlet thou hast thy father much offended
HAMLET
Mother you have my father much offended
QUEEN GERTRUDE
Come come you answer with an idle tongue
HAMLET
Go go you question with a wicked tongue
QUEEN GERTRUDE
Why how now Hamlet
HAMLET
Whats the matter now
QUEEN GERTRUDE
Have you forgot me
HAMLET
No by the rood not so
You are the queen your husbands brothers wife
Andwould it were not soyou are my mother
QUEEN GERTRUDE
Nay then Ill set those to you that can speak
HAMLET
Come come and sit you down you shall not budge
You go not till I set you up a glass
Where you may see the inmost part of you
QUEEN GERTRUDE
What wilt thou do thou wilt not murder me
Help help ho
LORD POLONIUS
Behind What ho help help help
HAMLET
Drawing How now a rat Dead for a ducat dead
Makes a pass through the arras

LORD POLONIUS
Behind O I am slain
Falls and dies

QUEEN GERTRUDE
O me what hast thou done
HAMLET
Nay I know not
Is it the king
QUEEN GERTRUDE
O what a rash and bloody deed is this
HAMLET
A bloody deed almost as bad good mother
As kill a king and marry with his brother
QUEEN GERTRUDE
As kill a king
HAMLET
Ay lady twas my word
Lifts up the array and discovers POLONIUS

Thou wretched rash intruding fool farewell
I took thee for thy better take thy fortune
Thou findst to be too busy is some danger
Leave wringing of your hands peace sit you down
And let me wring your heart for so I shall
If it be made of penetrable stuff
If damned custom have not brassd it so
That it is proof and bulwark against sense
QUEEN GERTRUDE
What have I done that thou darest wag thy tongue
In noise so rude against me
HAMLET
Such an act
That blurs the grace and blush of modesty
Calls virtue hypocrite takes off the rose
From the fair forehead of an innocent love
And sets a blister there makes marriagevows
As false as dicers oaths O such a deed
As from the body of contraction plucks
The very soul and sweet religion makes
A rhapsody of words heavens face doth glow
Yea this solidity and compound mass
With tristful visage as against the doom
Is thoughtsick at the act
QUEEN GERTRUDE
Ay me what act
That roars so loud and thunders in the index
HAMLET
Look here upon this picture and on this
The counterfeit presentment of two brothers
See what a grace was seated on this brow
Hyperions curls the front of Jove himself
An eye like Mars to threaten and command
A station like the herald Mercury
Newlighted on a heavenkissing hill
A combination and a form indeed
Where every god did seem to set his seal
To give the world assurance of a man
This was your husband Look you now what follows
Here is your husband like a mildewd ear
Blasting his wholesome brother Have you eyes
Could you on this fair mountain leave to feed
And batten on this moor Ha have you eyes
You cannot call it love for at your age
The heyday in the blood is tame its humble
And waits upon the judgment and what judgment
Would step from this to this Sense sure you have
Else could you not have motion but sure that sense
Is apoplexd for madness would not err
Nor sense to ecstasy was neer so thralld
But it reserved some quantity of choice
To serve in such a difference What devil wast
That thus hath cozend you at hoodmanblind
Eyes without feeling feeling without sight
Ears without hands or eyes smelling sans all
Or but a sickly part of one true sense
Could not so mope
O shame where is thy blush Rebellious hell
If thou canst mutine in a matrons bones
To flaming youth let virtue be as wax
And melt in her own fire proclaim no shame
When the compulsive ardour gives the charge
Since frost itself as actively doth burn
And reason panders will
QUEEN GERTRUDE
O Hamlet speak no more
Thou turnst mine eyes into my very soul
And there I see such black and grained spots
As will not leave their tinct
HAMLET
Nay but to live
In the rank sweat of an enseamed bed
Stewd in corruption honeying and making love
Over the nasty sty
QUEEN GERTRUDE
O speak to me no more
These words like daggers enter in mine ears
No more sweet Hamlet
HAMLET
A murderer and a villain
A slave that is not twentieth part the tithe
Of your precedent lord a vice of kings
A cutpurse of the empire and the rule
That from a shelf the precious diadem stole
And put it in his pocket
QUEEN GERTRUDE
No more
HAMLET
A king of shreds and patches
Enter Ghost

Save me and hover oer me with your wings
You heavenly guards What would your gracious figure
QUEEN GERTRUDE
Alas hes mad
HAMLET
Do you not come your tardy son to chide
That lapsed in time and passion lets go by
The important acting of your dread command O say
Ghost
Do not forget this visitation
Is but to whet thy almost blunted purpose
But look amazement on thy mother sits
O step between her and her fighting soul
Conceit in weakest bodies strongest works
Speak to her Hamlet
HAMLET
How is it with you lady
QUEEN GERTRUDE
Alas how ist with you
That you do bend your eye on vacancy
And with the incorporal air do hold discourse
Forth at your eyes your spirits wildly peep
And as the sleeping soldiers in the alarm
Your bedded hair like life in excrements
Starts up and stands on end O gentle son
Upon the heat and flame of thy distemper
Sprinkle cool patience Whereon do you look
HAMLET
On him on him Look you how pale he glares
His form and cause conjoind preaching to stones
Would make them capable Do not look upon me
Lest with this piteous action you convert
My stern effects then what I have to do
Will want true colour tears perchance for blood
QUEEN GERTRUDE
To whom do you speak this
HAMLET
Do you see nothing there
QUEEN GERTRUDE
Nothing at all yet all that is I see
HAMLET
Nor did you nothing hear
QUEEN GERTRUDE
No nothing but ourselves
HAMLET
Why look you there look how it steals away
My father in his habit as he lived
Look where he goes even now out at the portal
Exit Ghost

QUEEN GERTRUDE
This the very coinage of your brain
This bodiless creation ecstasy
Is very cunning in
HAMLET
Ecstasy
My pulse as yours doth temperately keep time
And makes as healthful music it is not madness
That I have utterd bring me to the test
And I the matter will reword which madness
Would gambol from Mother for love of grace
Lay not that mattering unction to your soul
That not your trespass but my madness speaks
It will but skin and film the ulcerous place
Whilst rank corruption mining all within
Infects unseen Confess yourself to heaven
Repent whats past avoid what is to come
And do not spread the compost on the weeds
To make them ranker Forgive me this my virtue
For in the fatness of these pursy times
Virtue itself of vice must pardon beg
Yea curb and woo for leave to do him good
QUEEN GERTRUDE
O Hamlet thou hast cleft my heart in twain
HAMLET
O throw away the worser part of it
And live the purer with the other half
Good night but go not to mine uncles bed
Assume a virtue if you have it not
That monster custom who all sense doth eat
Of habits devil is angel yet in this
That to the use of actions fair and good
He likewise gives a frock or livery
That aptly is put on Refrain tonight
And that shall lend a kind of easiness
To the next abstinence the next more easy
For use almost can change the stamp of nature
And either   the devil or throw him out
With wondrous potency Once more good night
And when you are desirous to be blessd
Ill blessing beg of you For this same lord
Pointing to POLONIUS

I do repent but heaven hath pleased it so
To punish me with this and this with me
That I must be their scourge and minister
I will bestow him and will answer well
The death I gave him So again good night
I must be cruel only to be kind
Thus bad begins and worse remains behind
One word more good lady
QUEEN GERTRUDE
What shall I do
HAMLET
Not this by no means that I bid you do
Let the bloat king tempt you again to bed
Pinch wanton on your cheek call you his mouse
And let him for a pair of reechy kisses
Or paddling in your neck with his damnd fingers
Make you to ravel all this matter out
That I essentially am not in madness
But mad in craft Twere good you let him know
For who thats but a queen fair sober wise
Would from a paddock from a bat a gib
Such dear concernings hide who would do so
No in despite of sense and secrecy
Unpeg the basket on the houses top
Let the birds fly and like the famous ape
To try conclusions in the basket creep
And break your own neck down
QUEEN GERTRUDE
Be thou assured if words be made of breath
And breath of life I have no life to breathe
What thou hast said to me
HAMLET
I must to England you know that
QUEEN GERTRUDE
Alack
I had forgot tis so concluded on
HAMLET
Theres letters seald and my two schoolfellows
Whom I will trust as I will adders fangd
They bear the mandate they must sweep my way
And marshal me to knavery Let it work
For tis the sport to have the engineer
Hoist with his own petard and t shall go hard
But I will delve one yard below their mines
And blow them at the moon O tis most sweet
When in one line two crafts directly meet
This man shall set me packing
Ill lug the guts into the neighbour room
Mother good night Indeed this counsellor
Is now most still most secret and most grave
Who was in life a foolish prating knave
Come sir to draw toward an end with you
Good night mother
Exeunt severally HAMLET dragging in POLONIUS

You must translate tis fit we understand them
Where is your son
QUEEN GERTRUDE
Bestow this place on us a little while
Exeunt ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN

Ah my good lord what have I seen tonight
KING CLAUDIUS
What Gertrude How does Hamlet
QUEEN GERTRUDE
Mad as the sea and wind when both contend
Which is the mightier in his lawless fit
Behind the arras hearing something stir
Whips out his rapier cries A rat a rat
And in this brainish apprehension kills
The unseen good old man
KING CLAUDIUS
O heavy deed
It had been so with us had we been there
His liberty is full of threats to all
To you yourself to us to every one
Alas how shall this bloody deed be answerd
It will be laid to us whose providence
Should have kept short restraind and out of haunt
This mad young man but so much was our love
We would not understand what was most fit
But like the owner of a foul disease
To keep it from divulging let it feed
Even on the pith of Life Where is he gone
QUEEN GERTRUDE
To draw apart the body he hath killd
Oer whom his very madness like some ore
Among a mineral of metals base
Shows itself pure he weeps for what is done
KING CLAUDIUS
O Gertrude come away
The sun no sooner shall the mountains touch
But we will ship him hence and this vile deed
We must with all our majesty and skill
Both countenance and excuse Ho Guildenstern
Reenter ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN

Friends both go join you with some further aid
Hamlet in madness hath Polonius slain
And from his mothers closet hath he draggd him
Go seek him out speak fair and bring the body
Into the chapel I pray you haste in this
Exeunt ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN

Come Gertrude well call up our wisest friends
And let them know both what we mean to do
And whats untimely done O come away
My soul is full of discord and dismay

ROSENCRANTZ
What have you done my lord with the dead body
HAMLET
Compounded it with dust whereto tis kin
ROSENCRANTZ
Tell us where tis that we may take it thence
And bear it to the chapel
HAMLET
Do not believe it
ROSENCRANTZ
Believe what
HAMLET
That I can keep your counsel and not mine own
Besides to be demanded of a sponge what
replication should be made by the son of a king
ROSENCRANTZ
Take you me for a sponge my lord
HAMLET
Ay sir that soaks up the kings countenance his
rewards his authorities But such officers do the
king best service in the end he keeps them like
an ape in the corner of his jaw first mouthed to
be last swallowed when he needs what you have
gleaned it is but squeezing you and sponge you
shall be dry again
ROSENCRANTZ
I understand you not my lord
HAMLET
I am glad of it a knavish speech sleeps in a
foolish ear
ROSENCRANTZ
My lord you must tell us where the body is and go
with us to the king
HAMLET
The body is with the king but the king is not with
the body The king is a thing
GUILDENSTERN
A thing my lord
HAMLET
Of nothing bring me to him Hide fox and all after
Exeunt

SCENE III Another room in the castle
Enter KING CLAUDIUS attended
KING CLAUDIUS
I have sent to seek him and to find the body
How dangerous is it that this man goes loose
Yet must not we put the strong law on him
Hes loved of the distracted multitude
Who like not in their judgment but their eyes
And where tis so the offenders scourge is weighd
But never the offence To bear all smooth and even
This sudden sending him away must seem
Deliberate pause diseases desperate grown
By desperate appliance are relieved
Or not at all
Enter ROSENCRANTZ

How now what hath befalln
ROSENCRANTZ
Where the dead body is bestowd my lord
We cannot get from him
KING CLAUDIUS
But where is he

convocation of politic worms are een at him Your
worm is your only emperor for diet we fat all
creatures else to fat us and we fat ourselves for
maggots your fat king and your lean beggar is but
variable service two dishes but to one table

KING CLAUDIUS
Alas alas
HAMLET
A man may fish with the worm that hath eat of a
king and eat of the fish that hath fed of that worm
KING CLAUDIUS
What dost you mean by this
HAMLET
Nothing but to show you how a king may go a
progress through the guts of a beggar
KING CLAUDIUS
Where is Polonius
HAMLET
In heaven send hither to see if your messenger
find him not there seek him i the other place

KING CLAUDIUS
Go seek him there
To some Attendants

HAMLET
He will stay till ye come
Exeunt Attendants

KING CLAUDIUS
Hamlet this deed for thine especial safety

KING CLAUDIUS

Delay it not Ill have him hence tonight
Away for every thing is seald and done
That else leans on the affair pray you make haste
Exeunt ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN

And England if my love thou holdst at aught
As my great power thereof may give thee sense
Since yet thy cicatrice looks raw and red
After the Danish sword and thy free awe
Pays homage to usthou mayst not coldly set
Our sovereign process which imports at full
By letters congruing to that effect
The present death of Hamlet Do it England
For like the hectic in my blood he rages
And thou must cure me till I know tis done
Howeer my haps my joys were neer begun
Exit

SCENE IV A plain in Denmark
Enter FORTINBRAS a Captain and Soldiers marching
PRINCE FORTINBRAS
Go captain from me greet the Danish king
Tell him that by his licence Fortinbras
Craves the conveyance of a promised march
Over his kingdom You know the rendezvous
If that his majesty would aught with us
We shall express our duty in his eye
And let him know so
Captain
I will dot my lord
PRINCE FORTINBRAS
Go softly on
Exeunt FORTINBRAS and Soldiers

Enter HAMLET ROSENCRANTZ GUILDENSTERN and others

HAMLET
Good sir whose powers are these
Captain
They are of Norway sir
HAMLET
How purposed sir I pray you
Captain
Against some part of Poland
HAMLET
Who commands them sir
Captain
The nephews to old Norway Fortinbras
HAMLET
Goes it against the main of Poland sir
Or for some frontier
Captain
Truly to speak and with no addition
We go to gain a little patch of ground
That hath in it no profit but the name
To pay five ducats five I would not farm it
Nor will it yield to Norway or the Pole
A ranker rate should it be sold in fee
HAMLET
Why then the Polack never will defend it
Captain
Yes it is already garrisond
HAMLET
Two thousand souls and twenty thousand ducats
Will not debate the question of this straw
This is the imposthume of much wealth and peace
That inward breaks and shows no cause without
Why the man dies I humbly thank you sir
Captain
God be wi you sir
Exit

ROSENCRANTZ
Wilt please you go my lord
HAMLET
Ill be with you straight go a little before
Exeunt all except HAMLET

How all occasions do inform against me
And spur my dull revenge What is a man
If his chief good and market of his time
Be but to sleep and feed a beast no more
Sure he that made us with such large discourse
Looking before and after gave us not
That capability and godlike reason
To fust in us unused Now whether it be
Bestial oblivion or some craven scruple
Of thinking too precisely on the event
A thought which quarterd hath but one part wisdom
And ever three parts coward I do not know
Why yet I live to say This things to do
Sith I have cause and will and strength and means
To dot Examples gross as earth exhort me
Witness this army of such mass and charge
Led by a delicate and tender prince
Whose spirit with divine ambition puffd
Makes mouths at the invisible event
Exposing what is mortal and unsure
To all that fortune death and danger dare
Even for an eggshell Rightly to be great
Is not to stir without great argument
But greatly to find quarrel in a straw
When honours at the stake How stand I then
That have a father killd a mother staind
Excitements of my reason and my blood
And let all sleep while to my shame I see
The imminent death of twenty thousand men
That for a fantasy and trick of fame
Go to their graves like beds fight for a plot
Whereon the numbers cannot try the cause
Which is not tomb enough and continent
To hide the slain O from this time forth
My thoughts be bloody or be nothing worth
Exit

SCENE V Elsinore A room in the castle
Enter QUEEN GERTRUDE HORATIO and a Gentleman
QUEEN GERTRUDE
I will not speak with her
Gentleman
She is importunate indeed distract
Her mood will needs be pitied
QUEEN GERTRUDE
What would she have
Gentleman
She speaks much of her father says she hears
Theres tricks i the world and hems and beats her heart
Spurns enviously at straws speaks things in doubt
That carry but half sense her speech is nothing
Yet the unshaped use of it doth move
The hearers to collection they aim at it
And botch the words up fit to their own thoughts
Which as her winks and nods and gestures
yield them
Indeed would make one think there might be thought
Though nothing sure yet much unhappily
HORATIO
Twere good she were spoken with for she may strew
Dangerous conjectures in illbreeding minds
QUEEN GERTRUDE
Let her come in
Exit HORATIO

To my sick soul as sins true nature is
Each toy seems prologue to some great amiss
So full of artless jealousy is guilt
It spills itself in fearing to be spilt
Reenter HORATIO with OPHELIA

OPHELIA
Where is the beauteous majesty of Denmark
QUEEN GERTRUDE
How now Ophelia
OPHELIA
Sings

And his sandal shoon
QUEEN GERTRUDE
Alas sweet lady what imports this song

KING CLAUDIUS
How long hath she been thus
OPHELIA
I hope all will be well We must be patient but I

Exit

KING CLAUDIUS
Follow her close give her good watch
I pray you
Exit HORATIO

O this is the poison of deep grief it springs
All from her fathers death O Gertrude Gertrude
When sorrows come they come not single spies
But in battalions First her father slain
Next your son gone and he most violent author
Of his own just remove the people muddied
Thick and unwholesome in their thoughts and whispers
For good Polonius death and we have done but greenly
In huggermugger to inter him poor Ophelia
Divided from herself and her fair judgment
Without the which we are pictures or mere beasts
Last and as much containing as all these
Her brother is in secret come from France
Feeds on his wonder keeps himself in clouds
And wants not buzzers to infect his ear
With pestilent speeches of his fathers death
Wherein necessity of matter beggard
Will nothing stick our person to arraign
In ear and ear O my dear Gertrude this
Like to a murderingpiece in many places
Gives me superfluous death
A noise within

QUEEN GERTRUDE
Alack what noise is this
KING CLAUDIUS
Where are my Switzers Let them guard the door
Enter another Gentleman

What is the matter
Gentleman
Save yourself my lord
The ocean overpeering of his list
Eats not the flats with more impetuous haste
Than young Laertes in a riotous head
Oerbears your officers The rabble call him lord
And as the world were now but to begin
Antiquity forgot custom not known
The ratifiers and props of every word
They cry Choose we Laertes shall be king
Caps hands and tongues applaud it to the clouds
Laertes shall be king Laertes king
QUEEN GERTRUDE
How cheerfully on the false trail they cry
O this is counter you false Danish dogs
KING CLAUDIUS
The doors are broke
Noise within

Enter LAERTES armed Danes following

LAERTES
Where is this king Sirs stand you all without
Danes
No lets come in
LAERTES
I pray you give me leave
Danes
We will we will
They retire without the door

LAERTES
I thank you keep the door O thou vile king
Give me my father
QUEEN GERTRUDE
Calmly good Laertes
LAERTES
That drop of blood thats calm proclaims me bastard
Cries cuckold to my father brands the harlot
Even here between the chaste unsmirched brow
Of my true mother
KING CLAUDIUS
What is the cause Laertes
That thy rebellion looks so giantlike
Let him go Gertrude do not fear our person
Theres such divinity doth hedge a king
That treason can but peep to what it would
Acts little of his will Tell me Laertes
Why thou art thus incensed Let him go Gertrude
Speak man
LAERTES
Where is my father
KING CLAUDIUS
Dead
QUEEN GERTRUDE
But not by him
KING CLAUDIUS
Let him demand his fill
LAERTES
How came he dead Ill not be juggled with
To hell allegiance vows to the blackest devil
Conscience and grace to the profoundest pit
I dare damnation To this point I stand
That both the worlds I give to negligence
Let come what comes only Ill be revenged
Most thoroughly for my father
KING CLAUDIUS
Who shall stay you
LAERTES
My will not all the world
And for my means Ill husband them so well
They shall go far with little
KING CLAUDIUS
Good Laertes
If you desire to know the certainty
Of your dear fathers death ist writ in your revenge
That swoopstake you will draw both friend and foe
Winner and loser
LAERTES
None but his enemies
KING CLAUDIUS
Will you know them then
LAERTES
To his good friends thus wide Ill ope my arms
And like the kind liferendering pelican
Repast them with my blood
KING CLAUDIUS
Why now you speak
Like a good child and a true gentleman
That I am guiltless of your fathers death
And am most sensible in grief for it
It shall as level to your judgment pierce
As day does to your eye
Danes
Within Let her come in
LAERTES
How now what noise is that
Reenter OPHELIA

O heat dry up my brains tears seven times salt
Burn out the sense and virtue of mine eye
By heaven thy madness shall be paid by weight
Till our scale turn the beam O rose of May
Dear maid kind sister sweet Ophelia
O heavens ist possible a young maids wits
Should be as moral as an old mans life
Nature is fine in love and where tis fine
It sends some precious instance of itself
After the thing it loves
OPHELIA
Sings
They bore him barefaced on the bier
Hey non nonny nonny hey nonny
And in his grave raind many a tear
Fare you well my dove
LAERTES
Hadst thou thy wits and didst persuade revenge
It could not move thus
OPHELIA
Sings
You must sing adown adown
An you call him adowna
O how the wheel becomes it It is the false
steward that stole his masters daughter
LAERTES
This nothings more than matter
OPHELIA
Theres rosemary thats for remembrance pray
love remember and there is pansies thats for thoughts
LAERTES
A document in madness thoughts and remembrance fitted
OPHELIA
Theres fennel for you and columbines theres rue

herbgrace o Sundays O you must wear your rue with
a difference Theres a daisy I would give you
some violets but they withered all when my father
died they say he made a good end
Sings

For bonny sweet Robin is all my joy
LAERTES
Thought and affliction passion hell itself
She turns to favour and to prettiness
OPHELIA
Sings
And will he not come again
And will he not come again
No no he is dead
Go to thy deathbed
He never will come again
His beard was as white as snow
All flaxen was his poll
He is gone he is gone
And we cast away moan
God ha mercy on his soul
And of all Christian souls I pray God God be wi ye
Exit

LAERTES
Do you see this O God
KING CLAUDIUS
Laertes I must commune with your grief
Or you deny me right Go but apart
Make choice of whom your wisest friends you will
And they shall hear and judge twixt you and me
If by direct or by collateral hand
They find us touchd we will our kingdom give
Our crown our life and all that we can ours
To you in satisfaction but if not
Be you content to lend your patience to us
And we shall jointly labour with your soul
To give it due content
LAERTES
Let this be so
His means of death his obscure funeral
No trophy sword nor hatchment oer his bones
No noble rite nor formal ostentation
Cry to be heard as twere from heaven to earth
That I must callt in question
KING CLAUDIUS
So you shall
And where the offence is let the great axe fall
I pray you go with me
Exeunt

SCENE VI Another room in the castle
Enter HORATIO and a Servant
HORATIO
What are they that would speak with me
Servant
Sailors sir they say they have letters for you
HORATIO
Let them come in
Exit Servant

I do not know from what part of the world
I should be greeted if not from Lord Hamlet
Enter Sailors

First Sailor
God bless you sir
HORATIO
Let him bless thee too
First Sailor
He shall sir ant please him Theres a letter for
you sir it comes from the ambassador that was
bound for England if your name be Horatio as I am
let to know it is
HORATIO
Reads Horatio when thou shalt have overlooked
this give these fellows some means to the king
they have letters for him Ere we were two days old
at sea a pirate of very warlike appointment gave us
chase Finding ourselves too slow of sail we put on
a compelled valour and in the grapple I boarded
them on the instant they got clear of our ship so
I alone became their prisoner They have dealt with
me like thieves of mercy but they knew what they
did I am to do a good turn for them Let the king
have the letters I have sent and repair thou to me
with as much speed as thou wouldst fly death I
have words to speak in thine ear will make thee
dumb yet are they much too light for the bore of
the matter These good fellows will bring thee
where I am Rosencrantz and Guildenstern hold their
course for England of them I have much to tell
thee Farewell
He that thou knowest thine HAMLET
Come I will make you way for these your letters
And dot the speedier that you may direct me
To him from whom you brought them
Exeunt

SCENE VII Another room in the castle
Enter KING CLAUDIUS and LAERTES
KING CLAUDIUS
Now must your conscience my acquaintance seal
And you must put me in your heart for friend
Sith you have heard and with a knowing ear
That he which hath your noble father slain
Pursued my life
LAERTES
It well appears but tell me
Why you proceeded not against these feats
So crimeful and so capital in nature
As by your safety wisdom all things else
You mainly were stirrd up
KING CLAUDIUS
O for two special reasons
Which may to you perhaps seem much unsinewd
But yet to me they are strong The queen his mother
Lives almost by his looks and for myself
My virtue or my plague be it either which
Shes so conjunctive to my life and soul
That as the star moves not but in his sphere
I could not but by her The other motive
Why to a public count I might not go
Is the great love the general gender bear him
Who dipping all his faults in their affection
Would like the spring that turneth wood to stone
Convert his gyves to graces so that my arrows
Too slightly timberd for so loud a wind
Would have reverted to my bow again
And not where I had aimd them
LAERTES
And so have I a noble father lost
A sister driven into desperate terms
Whose worth if praises may go back again
Stood challenger on mount of all the age
For her perfections but my revenge will come
KING CLAUDIUS
Break not your sleeps for that you must not think
That we are made of stuff so flat and dull
That we can let our beard be shook with danger
And think it pastime You shortly shall hear more
I loved your father and we love ourself
And that I hope will teach you to imagine
Enter a Messenger

How now what news
Messenger
Letters my lord from Hamlet
This to your majesty this to the queen
KING CLAUDIUS
From Hamlet who brought them
Messenger
Sailors my lord they say I saw them not
They were given me by Claudio he received them
Of him that brought them
KING CLAUDIUS
Laertes you shall hear them Leave us
Exit Messenger

Reads

High and mighty You shall know I am set naked on
your kingdom Tomorrow shall I beg leave to see
your kingly eyes when I shall first asking your
pardon thereunto recount the occasion of my sudden
and more strange return HAMLET
What should this mean Are all the rest come back
Or is it some abuse and no such thing
LAERTES
Know you the hand
KING CLAUDIUS
Tis Hamlets character Naked
And in a postscript here he says alone
Can you advise me
LAERTES
Im lost in it my lord But let him come
It warms the very sickness in my heart
That I shall live and tell him to his teeth
Thus didest thou
KING CLAUDIUS
If it be so Laertes
As how should it be so how otherwise
Will you be ruled by me
LAERTES
Ay my lord
So you will not oerrule me to a peace
KING CLAUDIUS
To thine own peace If he be now returnd
As checking at his voyage and that he means
No more to undertake it I will work him
To an exploit now ripe in my device
Under the which he shall not choose but fall
And for his death no wind of blame shall breathe
But even his mother shall uncharge the practise
And call it accident
LAERTES
My lord I will be ruled
The rather if you could devise it so
That I might be the organ
KING CLAUDIUS
It falls right
You have been talkd of since your travel much
And that in Hamlets hearing for a quality
Wherein they say you shine your sum of parts
Did not together pluck such envy from him
As did that one and that in my regard
Of the unworthiest siege
LAERTES
What part is that my lord
KING CLAUDIUS
A very riband in the cap of youth
Yet needful too for youth no less becomes
The light and careless livery that it wears
Than settled age his sables and his weeds
Importing health and graveness Two months since
Here was a gentleman of Normandy
Ive seen myself and served against the French
And they can well on horseback but this gallant
Had witchcraft int he grew unto his seat
And to such wondrous doing brought his horse
As he had been incorpsed and deminatured
With the brave beast so far he toppd my thought
That I in forgery of shapes and tricks
Come short of what he did
LAERTES
A Norman wast
KING CLAUDIUS
A Norman
LAERTES
Upon my life Lamond
KING CLAUDIUS
The very same
LAERTES
I know him well he is the brooch indeed
And gem of all the nation
KING CLAUDIUS
He made confession of you
And gave you such a masterly report
For art and exercise in your defence
And for your rapier most especially
That he cried out twould be a sight indeed
If one could match you the scrimers of their nation
He swore had had neither motion guard nor eye
If you opposed them Sir this report of his
Did Hamlet so envenom with his envy
That he could nothing do but wish and beg
Your sudden coming oer to play with him
Now out of this
LAERTES
What out of this my lord
KING CLAUDIUS
Laertes was your father dear to you
Or are you like the painting of a sorrow
A face without a heart
LAERTES
Why ask you this
KING CLAUDIUS
Not that I think you did not love your father
But that I know love is begun by time
And that I see in passages of proof
Time qualifies the spark and fire of it
There lives within the very flame of love
A kind of wick or snuff that will abate it
And nothing is at a like goodness still
For goodness growing to a plurisy
Dies in his own too much that we would do
We should do when we would for this would changes
And hath abatements and delays as many
As there are tongues are hands are accidents
And then this should is like a spendthrift sigh
That hurts by easing But to the quick o the ulcer
Hamlet comes back what would you undertake
To show yourself your fathers son in deed
More than in words
LAERTES
To cut his throat i the church
KING CLAUDIUS
No place indeed should murder sanctuarize
Revenge should have no bounds But good Laertes
Will you do this keep close within your chamber
Hamlet returnd shall know you are come home
Well put on those shall praise your excellence
And set a double varnish on the fame
The Frenchman gave you bring you in fine together
And wager on your heads he being remiss
Most generous and free from all contriving
Will not peruse the foils so that with ease
Or with a little shuffling you may choose
A sword unbated and in a pass of practise
Requite him for your father
LAERTES
I will dot
And for that purpose Ill anoint my sword
I bought an unction of a mountebank
So mortal that but dip a knife in it
Where it draws blood no cataplasm so rare
Collected from all simples that have virtue
Under the moon can save the thing from death
That is but scratchd withal Ill touch my point
With this contagion that if I gall him slightly
It may be death
KING CLAUDIUS
Lets further think of this
Weigh what convenience both of time and means
May fit us to our shape if this should fail
And that our drift look through our bad performance
Twere better not assayd therefore this project
Should have a back or second that might hold
If this should blast in proof Soft let me see
Well make a solemn wager on your cunnings I hat
When in your motion you are hot and dry
As make your bouts more violent to that end
And that he calls for drink Ill have prepared him
A chalice for the nonce whereon but sipping
If he by chance escape your venomd stuck
Our purpose may hold there
Enter QUEEN GERTRUDE

How now sweet queen
QUEEN GERTRUDE
One woe doth tread upon anothers heel
So fast they follow your sisters drownd Laertes
LAERTES
Drownd O where
QUEEN GERTRUDE
There is a willow grows aslant a brook
That shows his hoar leaves in the glassy stream
There with fantastic garlands did she come
Of crowflowers nettles daisies and long purples
That liberal shepherds give a grosser name
But our cold maids do dead mens fingers call them
There on the pendent boughs her coronet weeds
Clambering to hang an envious sliver broke
When down her weedy trophies and herself
Fell in the weeping brook Her clothes spread wide
And mermaidlike awhile they bore her up
Which time she chanted snatches of old tunes
As one incapable of her own distress
Or like a creature native and indued
Unto that element but long it could not be
Till that her garments heavy with their drink
Pulld the poor wretch from her melodious lay
To muddy death
LAERTES
Alas then she is drownd
QUEEN GERTRUDE
Drownd drownd
LAERTES
Too much of water hast thou poor Ophelia
And therefore I forbid my tears but yet
It is our trick nature her custom holds
Let shame say what it will when these are gone
The woman will be out Adieu my lord
I have a speech of fire that fain would blaze
But that this folly douts it
Exit

KING CLAUDIUS
Lets follow Gertrude
How much I had to do to calm his rage
Now fear I this will give it start again
Therefore lets follow
Exeunt

How can that be unless she drowned herself in her
own defence
Second Clown
Why tis found so

Second Clown
But is this law
First Clown
Ay marry ist crowners quest law
Second Clown
Will you ha the truth ont If this had not been
a gentlewoman she should have been buried out o
Christian burial
First Clown
Why there thou sayst and the more pity that
great folk should have countenance in this world to
drown or hang themselves more than their even
Christian Come my spade There is no ancient
gentleman but gardeners ditchers and gravemakers
they hold up Adams profession
Second Clown
Was he a gentleman
First Clown
He was the first that ever bore arms
Second Clown
Why he had none

question to thee if thou answerest me not to the
purpose confess thyself

mason the shipwright or the carpenter
Second Clown
The gallowsmaker for that frame outlives a
thousand tenants
First Clown

those that do in now thou dost ill to say the
gallows is built stronger than the church argal

Enter HAMLET and HORATIO at a distance

First Clown
Cudgel thy brains no more about it for your dull
ass will not mend his pace with beating and when
you are asked this question next say a
gravemaker the houses that he makes last till
doomsday Go get thee to Yaughan fetch me a
stoup of liquor
Exit Second Clown

He digs and sings

In youth when I did love did love
Methought it was very sweet
To contract O the time for ah my behove
O methought there was nothing meet
HAMLET
Has this fellow no feeling of his business that he
sings at gravemaking
HORATIO
Custom hath made it in him a property of easiness
HAMLET
Tis een so the hand of little employment hath
the daintier sense
First Clown
Sings
But age with his stealing steps
Hath clawd me in his clutch
And hath shipped me intil the land
As if I had never been such
Throws up a skull

HAMLET
That skull had a tongue in it and could sing once
how the knave jowls it to the ground as if it were
Cains jawbone that did the first murder It
might be the pate of a politician which this ass
now oerreaches one that would circumvent God
might it not
HORATIO
It might my lord
HAMLET
Or of a courtier which could say Good morrow
sweet lord How dost thou good lord This might
be my lord suchaone that praised my lord
suchaones horse when he meant to beg it might it not
HORATIO
Ay my lord
HAMLET
Why een so and now my Lady Worms chapless and
knocked about the mazzard with a sextons spade

but to play at loggats with em mine ache to think ont
First Clown
Sings
A pickaxe and a spade a spade
For and a shrouding sheet
O a pit of clay for to be made
For such a guest is meet
Throws up another skull

HAMLET
Theres another why may not that be the skull of a
lawyer Where be his quiddities now his quillets
his cases his tenures and his tricks why does he
suffer this rude knave now to knock him about the
sconce with a dirty shovel and will not tell him of
his action of battery Hum This fellow might be
ins time a great buyer of land with his statutes
his recognizances his fines his double vouchers
his recoveries is this the fine of his fines and
the recovery of his recoveries to have his fine
pate full of fine dirt will his vouchers vouch him
no more of his purchases and double ones too than
the length and breadth of a pair of indentures The
very conveyances of his lands will hardly lie in
this box and must the inheritor himself have no more ha
HORATIO
Not a jot more my lord
HAMLET

HORATIO

One that was a woman sir but rest her soul shes dead
HAMLET
How absolute the knave is we must speak by the
card or equivocation will undo us By the Lord
Horatio these three years I have taken a note of
it the age is grown so picked that the toe of the
peasant comes so near the heel of the courtier he
gaffs his kibe How long hast thou been a
gravemaker
First Clown
Of all the days i the year I came tot that day
that our last king Hamlet overcame Fortinbras
HAMLET
How long is that since
First Clown
Cannot you tell that every fool can tell that it
was the very day that young Hamlet was born he that
is mad and sent into England
HAMLET
Ay marry why was he sent into England
First Clown
Why because he was mad he shall recover his wits
there or if he do not its no great matter there
HAMLET
Why
First Clown
Twill a not be seen in him there there the men
are as mad as he
HAMLET
How came he mad
First Clown
Very strangely they say
HAMLET
How strangely
First Clown
Faith een with losing his wits
HAMLET
Upon what ground
First Clown
Why here in Denmark I have been sexton here man
and boy thirty years
HAMLET
How long will a man lie i the earth ere he rot
First Clown
I faith if he be not rotten before he dieas we
have many pocky corses nowadays that will scarce
hold the laying inhe will last you some eight year
or nine year a tanner will last you nine year
HAMLET
Why he more than another
First Clown
Why sir his hide is so tanned with his trade that
he will keep out water a great while and your water
is a sore decayer of your whoreson dead body
Heres a skull now this skull has lain in the earth
three and twenty years
HAMLET

First Clown
A whoreson mad fellows it was whose do you think it was
HAMLET

First Clown
A pestilence on him for a mad rogue a poured a
flagon of Rhenish on my head once This same skull
sir was Yoricks skull the kings jester
HAMLET
This
First Clown
Een that
HAMLET
Let me see
Takes the skull

Alas poor Yorick I knew him Horatio a fellow
of infinite jest of most excellent fancy he hath
borne me on his back a thousand times and now how
abhorred in my imagination it is my gorge rims at
it Here hung those lips that I have kissed I know
not how oft Where be your gibes now your
gambols your songs your flashes of merriment
that were wont to set the table on a roar Not one
now to mock your own grinning quite chapfallen
Now get you to my ladys chamber and tell her let
her paint an inch thick to this favour she must
come make her laugh at that Prithee Horatio tell
me one thing
HORATIO
Whats that my lord
HAMLET
Dost thou think Alexander looked o this fashion i
the earth
HORATIO
Een so
HAMLET
And smelt so pah
Puts down the skull

HORATIO
Een so my lord
HAMLET
To what base uses we may return Horatio Why may
not imagination trace the noble dust of Alexander
till he find it stopping a bunghole
HORATIO
Twere to consider too curiously to consider so
HAMLET
No faith not a jot but to follow him thither with
modesty enough and likelihood to lead it as
thus Alexander died Alexander was buried
Alexander returneth into dust the dust is earth of
earth we make loam and why of that loam whereto he
was converted might they not stop a beerbarrel
Imperious Caesar dead and turnd to clay
Might stop a hole to keep the wind away
O that that earth which kept the world in awe
Should patch a wall to expel the winter flaw
But soft but soft aside here comes the king
Enter Priest  c in procession the Corpse of OPHELIA LAERTES and Mourners following KING CLAUDIUS QUEEN GERTRUDE their trains  c

The queen the courtiers who is this they follow
And with such maimed rites This doth betoken
The corse they follow did with desperate hand
Fordo its own life twas of some estate
Couch we awhile and mark
Retiring with HORATIO

LAERTES
What ceremony else
HAMLET
That is Laertes
A very noble youth mark
LAERTES
What ceremony else
First Priest
Her obsequies have been as far enlarged
As we have warrantise her death was doubtful
And but that great command oersways the order
She should in ground unsanctified have lodged
Till the last trumpet for charitable prayers
Shards flints and pebbles should be thrown on her
Yet here she is allowd her virgin crants
Her maiden strewments and the bringing home
Of bell and burial
LAERTES
Must there no more be done
First Priest
No more be done
We should profane the service of the dead
To sing a requiem and such rest to her
As to peaceparted souls
LAERTES
Lay her i the earth
And from her fair and unpolluted flesh
May violets spring I tell thee churlish priest
A ministering angel shall my sister be
When thou liest howling
HAMLET
What the fair Ophelia
QUEEN GERTRUDE
Sweets to the sweet farewell
Scattering flowers

I hoped thou shouldst have been my Hamlets wife
I thought thy bridebed to have deckd sweet maid
And not have strewd thy grave
LAERTES
O treble woe
Fall ten times treble on that cursed head
Whose wicked deed thy most ingenious sense
Deprived thee of Hold off the earth awhile
Till I have caught her once more in mine arms
Leaps into the grave

Now pile your dust upon the quick and dead
Till of this flat a mountain you have made
To oertop old Pelion or the skyish head
Of blue Olympus
HAMLET
Advancing What is he whose grief
Bears such an emphasis whose phrase of sorrow
Conjures the wandering stars and makes them stand
Like wonderwounded hearers This is I
Hamlet the Dane
Leaps into the grave

LAERTES
The devil take thy soul
Grappling with him

HAMLET
Thou prayst not well
I prithee take thy fingers from my throat
For though I am not splenitive and rash
Yet have I something in me dangerous
Which let thy wiseness fear hold off thy hand
KING CLAUDIUS
Pluck them asunder
QUEEN GERTRUDE
Hamlet Hamlet
All
Gentlemen
HORATIO
Good my lord be quiet
The Attendants part them and they come out of the grave

HAMLET
Why I will fight with him upon this theme
Until my eyelids will no longer wag
QUEEN GERTRUDE
O my son what theme
HAMLET
I loved Ophelia forty thousand brothers
Could not with all their quantity of love
Make up my sum What wilt thou do for her
KING CLAUDIUS
O he is mad Laertes
QUEEN GERTRUDE
For love of God forbear him
HAMLET
Swounds show me what thoult do
Woot weep woot fight woot fast woot tear thyself
Woot drink up eisel eat a crocodile
Ill dot Dost thou come here to whine
To outface me with leaping in her grave
Be buried quick with her and so will I
And if thou prate of mountains let them throw
Millions of acres on us till our ground
Singeing his pate against the burning zone
Make Ossa like a wart Nay an thoult mouth
Ill rant as well as thou
QUEEN GERTRUDE
This is mere madness
And thus awhile the fit will work on him
Anon as patient as the female dove
When that her golden couplets are disclosed
His silence will sit drooping
HAMLET
Hear you sir
What is the reason that you use me thus
I loved you ever but it is no matter
Let Hercules himself do what he may
The cat will mew and dog will have his day
Exit

KING CLAUDIUS
I pray you good Horatio wait upon him
Exit HORATIO

To LAERTES

Strengthen your patience in our last nights speech
Well put the matter to the present push
Good Gertrude set some watch over your son
This grave shall have a living monument
An hour of quiet shortly shall we see
Till then in patience our proceeding be
Exeunt

SCENE II A hall in the castle
Enter HAMLET and HORATIO
HAMLET
So much for this sir now shall you see the other
You do remember all the circumstance
HORATIO
Remember it my lord
HAMLET
Sir in my heart there was a kind of fighting
That would not let me sleep methought I lay
Worse than the mutines in the bilboes Rashly
And praised be rashness for it let us know
Our indiscretion sometimes serves us well
When our deep plots do pall and that should teach us
Theres a divinity that shapes our ends
Roughhew them how we will
HORATIO
That is most certain
HAMLET
Up from my cabin
My seagown scarfd about me in the dark
Groped I to find out them had my desire
Fingerd their packet and in fine withdrew
To mine own room again making so bold
My fears forgetting manners to unseal
Their grand commission where I found Horatio
O royal knaveryan exact command
Larded with many several sorts of reasons
Importing Denmarks health and Englands too
With ho such bugs and goblins in my life
That on the supervise no leisure bated
No not to stay the grinding of the axe
My head should be struck off
HORATIO
Ist possible
HAMLET
Heres the commission read it at more leisure
But wilt thou hear me how I did proceed
HORATIO
I beseech you
HAMLET
Being thus benetted round with villanies
Ere I could make a prologue to my brains
They had begun the playI sat me down
Devised a new commission wrote it fair
I once did hold it as our statists do
A baseness to write fair and labourd much
How to forget that learning but sir now
It did me yeomans service wilt thou know
The effect of what I wrote
HORATIO
Ay good my lord
HAMLET
An earnest conjuration from the king
As England was his faithful tributary
As love between them like the palm might flourish
As peace should stiff her wheaten garland wear
And stand a comma tween their amities
And many suchlike Ases of great charge
That on the view and knowing of these contents
Without debatement further more or less
He should the bearers put to sudden death
Not shrivingtime allowd
HORATIO
How was this seald
HAMLET
Why even in that was heaven ordinant
I had my fathers signet in my purse
Which was the model of that Danish seal
Folded the writ up in form of the other
Subscribed it gavet the impression placed it safely
The changeling never known Now the next day
Was our seafight and what to this was sequent
Thou knowst already
HORATIO
So Guildenstern and Rosencrantz go tot
HAMLET
Why man they did make love to this employment
They are not near my conscience their defeat
Does by their own insinuation grow
Tis dangerous when the baser nature comes
Between the pass and fell incensed points
Of mighty opposites
HORATIO
Why what a king is this
HAMLET
Does it not thinkst thee stand me now upon
He that hath killd my king and whored my mother
Poppd in between the election and my hopes
Thrown out his angle for my proper life
And with such cozenageist not perfect conscience
To quit him with this arm and ist not to be damnd
To let this canker of our nature come
In further evil
HORATIO
It must be shortly known to him from England
What is the issue of the business there
HAMLET
It will be short the interim is mine
And a mans lifes no more than to say One
But I am very sorry good Horatio
That to Laertes I forgot myself
For by the image of my cause I see
The portraiture of his Ill court his favours
But sure the bravery of his grief did put me
Into a towering passion
HORATIO
Peace who comes here
Enter OSRIC

OSRIC
Your lordship is right welcome back to Denmark
HAMLET
I humbly thank you sir Dost know this waterfly
HORATIO
No my good lord
HAMLET
Thy state is the more gracious for tis a vice to
know him He hath much land and fertile let a
beast be lord of beasts and his crib shall stand at
the kings mess tis a chough but as I say
spacious in the possession of dirt
OSRIC
Sweet lord if your lordship were at leisure I
should impart a thing to you from his majesty
HAMLET
I will receive it sir with all diligence of
spirit Put your bonnet to his right use tis for the head
OSRIC
I thank your lordship it is very hot
HAMLET
No believe me tis very cold the wind is
northerly
OSRIC
It is indifferent cold my lord indeed
HAMLET
But yet methinks it is very sultry and hot for my
complexion
OSRIC
Exceedingly my lord it is very sultryas
twereI cannot tell how But my lord his
majesty bade me signify to you that he has laid a
great wager on your head sir this is the matter
HAMLET
I beseech you remember
HAMLET moves him to put on his hat

OSRIC
Nay good my lord for mine ease in good faith
Sir here is newly come to court Laertes believe
me an absolute gentleman full of most excellent
differences of very soft society and great showing
indeed to speak feelingly of him he is the card or
calendar of gentry for you shall find in him the
continent of what part a gentleman would see
HAMLET
Sir his definement suffers no perdition in you
though I know to divide him inventorially would
dizzy the arithmetic of memory and yet but yaw
neither in respect of his quick sail But in the
verity of extolment I take him to be a soul of
great article and his infusion of such dearth and
rareness as to make true diction of him his
semblable is his mirror and who else would trace
him his umbrage nothing more
OSRIC
Your lordship speaks most infallibly of him
HAMLET
The concernancy sir why do we wrap the gentleman
in our more rawer breath
OSRIC
Sir
HORATIO
Ist not possible to understand in another tongue
You will dot sir really
HAMLET
What imports the nomination of this gentleman
OSRIC
Of Laertes
HORATIO
His purse is empty already alls golden words are spent
HAMLET
Of him sir
OSRIC
I know you are not ignorant
HAMLET
I would you did sir yet in faith if you did
it would not much approve me Well sir
OSRIC
You are not ignorant of what excellence Laertes is
HAMLET
I dare not confess that lest I should compare with
him in excellence but to know a man well were to
know himself
OSRIC
I mean sir for his weapon but in the imputation
laid on him by them in his meed hes unfellowed
HAMLET
Whats his weapon
OSRIC
Rapier and dagger
HAMLET
Thats two of his weapons but well
OSRIC
The king sir hath wagered with him six Barbary
horses against the which he has imponed as I take
it six French rapiers and poniards with their
assigns as girdle hangers and so three of the
carriages in faith are very dear to fancy very
responsive to the hilts most delicate carriages
and of very liberal conceit
HAMLET
What call you the carriages
HORATIO
I knew you must be edified by the margent ere you had done
OSRIC
The carriages sir are the hangers
HAMLET
The phrase would be more german to the matter if we
could carry cannon by our sides I would it might
be hangers till then But on six Barbary horses
against six French swords their assigns and three
liberalconceited carriages thats the French bet
against the Danish Why is this imponed as you call it
OSRIC
The king sir hath laid that in a dozen passes
between yourself and him he shall not exceed you
three hits he hath laid on twelve for nine and it
would come to immediate trial if your lordship
would vouchsafe the answer
HAMLET
How if I answer no
OSRIC
I mean my lord the opposition of your person in trial
HAMLET
Sir I will walk here in the hall if it please his
majesty tis the breathing time of day with me let
the foils be brought the gentleman willing and the
king hold his purpose I will win for him an I can
if not I will gain nothing but my shame and the odd hits
OSRIC
Shall I redeliver you een so
HAMLET
To this effect sir after what flourish your nature will
OSRIC
I commend my duty to your lordship
HAMLET
Yours yours
Exit OSRIC

He does well to commend it himself there are no
tongues else fors turn
HORATIO
This lapwing runs away with the shell on his head
HAMLET
He did comply with his dug before he sucked it
Thus has heand many more of the same bevy that I
know the dressy age dotes ononly got the tune of
the time and outward habit of encounter a kind of
yesty collection which carries them through and
through the most fond and winnowed opinions and do
but blow them to their trial the bubbles are out
Enter a Lord

Lord
My lord his majesty commended him to you by young
Osric who brings back to him that you attend him in
the hall he sends to know if your pleasure hold to
play with Laertes or that you will take longer time
HAMLET
I am constant to my purpose they follow the kings
pleasure if his fitness speaks mine is ready now
or whensoever provided I be so able as now
Lord
The king and queen and all are coming down
HAMLET
In happy time
Lord
The queen desires you to use some gentle
entertainment to Laertes before you fall to play
HAMLET
She well instructs me
Exit Lord

HORATIO
You will lose this wager my lord
HAMLET
I do not think so since he went into France I
have been in continual practise I shall win at the
odds But thou wouldst not think how ill alls here
about my heart but it is no matter
HORATIO
Nay good my lord
HAMLET
It is but foolery but it is such a kind of
gaingiving as would perhaps trouble a woman
HORATIO
If your mind dislike any thing obey it I will
forestall their repair hither and say you are not
fit
HAMLET
Not a whit we defy augury theres a special
providence in the fall of a sparrow If it be now
tis not to come if it be not to come it will be
now if it be not now yet it will come the
readiness is all since no man has aught of what he
leaves what ist to leave betimes
Enter KING CLAUDIUS QUEEN GERTRUDE LAERTES Lords OSRIC and Attendants with foils  c

KING CLAUDIUS
Come Hamlet come and take this hand from me
KING CLAUDIUS puts LAERTES hand into HAMLETs

HAMLET
Give me your pardon sir Ive done you wrong
But pardont as you are a gentleman
This presence knows
And you must needs have heard how I am punishd
With sore distraction What I have done
That might your nature honour and exception
Roughly awake I here proclaim was madness
Wast Hamlet wrongd Laertes Never Hamlet
If Hamlet from himself be taen away
And when hes not himself does wrong Laertes
Then Hamlet does it not Hamlet denies it
Who does it then His madness ift be so
Hamlet is of the faction that is wrongd
His madness is poor Hamlets enemy
Sir in this audience
Let my disclaiming from a purposed evil
Free me so far in your most generous thoughts
That I have shot mine arrow oer the house
And hurt my brother
LAERTES
I am satisfied in nature
Whose motive in this case should stir me most
To my revenge but in my terms of honour
I stand aloof and will no reconcilement
Till by some elder masters of known honour
I have a voice and precedent of peace
To keep my name ungored But till that time
I do receive your offerd love like love
And will not wrong it
HAMLET
I embrace it freely
And will this brothers wager frankly play
Give us the foils Come on
LAERTES
Come one for me
HAMLET

Your skill shall like a star i the darkest night
Stick fiery off indeed
LAERTES
You mock me sir
HAMLET
No by this hand
KING CLAUDIUS
Give them the foils young Osric Cousin Hamlet
You know the wager
HAMLET

Your grace hath laid the odds o the weaker side
KING CLAUDIUS

But since he is betterd we have therefore odds
LAERTES
This is too heavy let me see another
HAMLET
This likes me well These foils have all a length
They prepare to play

OSRIC
Ay my good lord
KING CLAUDIUS
Set me the stoops of wine upon that table
If Hamlet give the first or second hit
Or quit in answer of the third exchange
Let all the battlements their ordnance fire
The king shall drink to Hamlets better breath
And in the cup an union shall he throw
Richer than that which four successive kings
In Denmarks crown have worn Give me the cups
And let the kettle to the trumpet speak
The trumpet to the cannoneer without
The cannons to the heavens the heavens to earth
Now the king dunks to Hamlet Come begin
And you the judges bear a wary eye
HAMLET
Come on sir
LAERTES

HAMLET
O villany Ho let the door be lockd
Treachery Seek it out
LAERTES
It is here Hamlet Hamlet thou art slain
No medicine in the world can do thee good
In thee there is not half an hour of life
The treacherous instrument is in thy hand
Unbated and envenomd the foul practise
Hath turnd itself on me lo here I lie
Never to rise again thy mothers poisond
I can no more the king the kings to blame
HAMLET
The pointenvenomd too
Then venom to thy work

HAMLET

KING CLAUDIUS dies

LAERTES
He is justly served
It is a poison temperd by himself
Exchange forgiveness with me noble Hamlet
Mine and my fathers death come not upon thee
Nor thine on me
Dies

HAMLET
Heaven make thee free of it I follow thee
I am dead Horatio Wretched queen adieu
You that look pale and tremble at this chance
That are but mutes or audience to this act
Had I but timeas this fell sergeant death
Is strict in his arrestO I could tell you
But let it be Horatio I am dead
Thou livest report me and my cause aright
To the unsatisfied
HORATIO
Never believe it
I am more an antique Roman than a Dane
Heres yet some liquor left
HAMLET
As thourt a man
Give me the cup let go by heaven Ill havet
O good Horatio what a wounded name
Things standing thus unknown shall live behind me
If thou didst ever hold me in thy heart
Absent thee from felicity awhile
And in this harsh world draw thy breath in pain
To tell my story
March afar off and shot within

What warlike noise is this
OSRIC
Young Fortinbras with conquest come from Poland
To the ambassadors of England gives
This warlike volley
HAMLET
O I die Horatio
The potent poison quite oercrows my spirit
I cannot live to hear the news from England
But I do prophesy the election lights
On Fortinbras he has my dying voice
So tell him with the occurrents more and less
Which have solicited The rest is silence
Dies

HORATIO
Now cracks a noble heart Good night sweet prince
And flights of angels sing thee to thy rest
Why does the drum come hither
March within

Enter FORTINBRAS the English Ambassadors and others

PRINCE FORTINBRAS
Where is this sight
HORATIO
What is it ye would see
If aught of woe or wonder cease your search
PRINCE FORTINBRAS
This quarry cries on havoc O proud death
What feast is toward in thine eternal cell
That thou so many princes at a shot
So bloodily hast struck
First Ambassador
The sight is dismal
And our affairs from England come too late
The ears are senseless that should give us hearing
To tell him his commandment is fulfilld
That Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are dead
Where should we have our thanks
HORATIO
Not from his mouth
Had it the ability of life to thank you
He never gave commandment for their death
But since so jump upon this bloody question
You from the Polack wars and you from England
Are here arrived give order that these bodies
High on a stage be placed to the view
And let me speak to the yet unknowing world
How these things came about so shall you hear
Of carnal bloody and unnatural acts
Of accidental judgments casual slaughters
Of deaths put on by cunning and forced cause
And in this upshot purposes mistook
Falln on the inventors reads all this can I
Truly deliver
PRINCE FORTINBRAS
Let us haste to hear it
And call the noblest to the audience
For me with sorrow I embrace my fortune
I have some rights of memory in this kingdom
Which now to claim my vantage doth invite me
HORATIO
Of that I shall have also cause to speak
And from his mouth whose voice will draw on more
But let this same be presently performd
Even while mens minds are wild lest more mischance
On plots and errors happen
PRINCE FORTINBRAS
Let four captains
Bear Hamlet like a soldier to the stage
For he was likely had he been put on
To have proved most royally and for his passage
The soldiers music and the rites of war
Speak loudly for him
Take up the bodies such a sight as this
Becomes the field but here shows much amiss
Go bid the soldiers shoot
A dead march Exeunt bearing off the dead bodies after which a peal of ordnance is shot off
